"""packaging/copies.py [--check] — files two hosts need in their own place, written from one source.

skills/axiomengine/                       the skill's text, for Gemini CLI
plugins/axiomengine/rules/axiomengine.mdc   AGENTS.md as an always-applied rule, for Cursor

Gemini:

Gemini CLI installs an extension from the repository root and finds skills only in <root>/skills/, while
the skill lives in plugins/axiomengine/skills/ where every other host reads it. A symlink does not survive
the install: Gemini clones into a temporary directory, copies it with fs.cp, which rewrites a relative
link into an absolute one inside that directory, and then deletes the directory.

So skills/axiomengine/ holds a copy of SKILL.md and reference/, and nothing else. The scripts stay in the
plugin: the copy's fallback command is rewritten to reach them from the repository root, which Gemini
installs whole.

Cursor: a plugin's always-on guidance is a rule, a .mdc file with frontmatter, where the other hosts read
AGENTS.md. The rule is AGENTS.md under that frontmatter.

Run this after editing the skill or AGENTS.md; tests/manifests.py fails while a copy differs.

    python3 packaging/copies.py          write the copies
    python3 packaging/copies.py --check  exit 1 if a copy is stale
