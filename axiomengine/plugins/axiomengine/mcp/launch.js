// launch.js — start the MCP server, resolving the Python MCP SDK rather than assuming it.
//
// WHY NODE AND NOT BASH (#1233). The manifests have no per-platform variants, so their command must be
// one program name that means the right thing everywhere. `bash` does not: on Windows it is WSL's or
// nothing (see find-bash.js), and the server never started (CONNECTION_CLOSED). `python3` does not
// either: on Windows it is a Microsoft Store placeholder and a python.org install has only `python`,
// while macOS and Linux may have only `python3`. `node` is the same name on every platform, and building
// a graph already needs it.
//
// server.py imports `mcp`, and nothing on a fresh machine installs it: the plugin declares no Python
// dependency and npm cannot express one. Order: an interpreter that already has the SDK wins (fastest, no
// network, respects a venv the user set up). Otherwise uv fetches it into an ephemeral environment, which
// is the one command that works on a clean machine without asking to install anything globally. Otherwise
// any interpreter that runs, because server.py carries a dependency-free fallback for the sliver of the
// protocol it uses and says on stderr which half it is running (#1105). An interpreter is taken only if
// it actually runs, so the WindowsApps placeholders, which exist on PATH and exit 9009, are passed over.
//
// uv is taken only once it has built its environment, not merely because it is on PATH (#1249). A failed
// resolve (offline, a proxy, a transitive dependency with no wheel for the host, such as an x86_64 uv under
// Rosetta asked for `cryptography`) makes the real start exit before `initialize`, and the client sees only
// CONNECTION_CLOSED while the fallback that would have served is never tried. So uv is first asked to import
// the SDK in that same environment, within a time limit; on success its cache is warm and the real start
// reuses it, on failure the launcher says why and moves on to the fallback.
//
// The server shells out to the CLI, a bash script, so the bash find-bash.js chose is handed to it as
// AXIOMENGINE_BASH; a bare `bash` from server.py would hit the same Windows lookup this file avoids. That CLI
// calls `python3`, so the server's environment also carries find-python.js's python3 for bash (#1331).
