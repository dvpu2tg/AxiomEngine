"""UserPromptSubmit: answer "where is this" before the agent thinks to ask.

The active verbs only help an agent that calls them, and the one measurement of this skill in an agent's
hands recorded no graph queries at all in six of six runs — the gap was never the answer, it was that
nobody asked the question. The passive half already enriches a Read or a grep AFTER the agent has chosen
where to look; this fires BEFORE, on the task itself, which is the only moment where orientation changes
which file gets opened first.

Rules it holds itself to:
  · ONCE per session. Orientation is a first-turn need; repeating it on every prompt is noise that costs
    context on every turn and changes nothing after the first.
  · SILENT unless it has something. No graph, no index, nothing matching — say nothing at all rather than
    announce that it has no answer.
  · BOUNDED. A handful of lines. This is a nudge toward the right package, not a second answer competing
    with what the agent asked for.
  · It never says it is certain. When several roots match it offers them instead of choosing, because
    picking the wrong package confidently is the failure this skill has already been bitten by.
