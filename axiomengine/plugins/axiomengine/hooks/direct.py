"""PreToolUse on Read|Grep|Glob|Bash (and the graph's own MCP tools, which silence it): say it at the moment the alternative is about to run.

#1100 measured three changes to what this skill SAYS and none of them moved the number: the body cut by
72%, the description rewritten into the words a task is phrased in, and orient.py's first turn turned from
bare directory names into ranked entry points. `graph_calls` stayed 0 in 17 of 18 runs. What those three
have in common is WHERE they speak: a surface the agent reads once, before it has a question.

This is the other axis. Not better wording — the same claim, placed at the only moment it competes with
anything: immediately before a raw search or read, which is the action it is asking to come second.

Rules it holds itself to, in the spirit of orient.py:
  · SILENT WITHOUT A GRAPH. No graph.sqlite means the verbs cannot answer, and a directive toward a tool
    that has nothing to say is pure noise. This is the difference between a directive and a nag.
  · SILENT WHEN THE AGENT IS ALREADY DOING IT. A Bash call that IS an axiomengine verb gets nothing.
  · NEVER BLOCKS. additionalContext, exit 0. The agent keeps its own judgement; the point is that the
    judgement is made with the option in view, not that the option wins.
  · ONCE PER SESSION, WHEREVER THE SESSION GOES. Said once, then never again. It used to repeat as one line before
    every later Read, Grep and Bash; then it was stamped once per session PER REPOSITORY, inside that repository's
    .axiomengine/, so an agent moving between a worktree, its fixtures and a corpus app heard the full text in each,
    and one whose .axiomengine/ it could not write heard it before every search. The stamp now lives in the temp
    directory, keyed by the session alone.
  · ONLY WHEN IT CAN NAME WHAT THIS SEARCH IS ABOUT. The generic text was spoken before the first search whatever
    it searched for, and a feed audit found it acted on 0% of the time: advice about "a name" in front of a search
    for `TODO` or `'use strict'` is not advice about this search. It now speaks only before a search whose pattern
    names a class, function or method the graph declares, names it with where it is, and gives the one call that
    answers what the grep is asking. A Read of a file already chosen and a Glob for files are not that question.
  · ONLY WHERE THE CHOICE IS. A Bash call that searches source competes with the graph; `git`, `ls`, a build, a
    test run, or a grep filtering another command's output does not, and a directive in front of one is noise.
