"""Change impact at every moment an edit happens, not only through the Edit tool.

  PreToolUse   Edit / Write / MultiEdit   the edit is applied to a copy of the file; when it changes a SIGNATURE, a FIELD's
                                          type, a TYPE header, or removes a declaration, the blast radius is given BEFORE the
                                          file changes (a body-only edit is reported after, by enrich.py — nothing breaks)
  PostToolUse  Bash                       a command that can modify sources (sed -i, patch, git apply / checkout / pull / merge /
                                          stash pop / cherry-pick / revert, a redirect into a source file, a script run): the

                                          and has not been reported in this session, on the next prompt

Every declaration is reported once per session (state next to the graph). Each line comes from `axiomengine changed` (which
declaration, how) and `axiomengine impact` (what must change with it, who produces / writes it, who reads it, what reaches
those, the tests) — ≤ 3 declarations per event, in parallel, a few lines each."""
