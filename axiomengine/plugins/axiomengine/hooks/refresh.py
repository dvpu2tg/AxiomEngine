"""Keep the graph current between runs (#1305): after an edit, a shell command, a finished turn, at session start and
on a prompt, start the background refresher and return. Nothing is waited on and nothing is printed.

The refresher (skills/axiomengine/scripts/ax_fresh.py) compares the files the parser reads against the table recorded
at the last build, and rebuilds only when one differs, one build at a time per repository, while every verb and hook
keeps reading the previous graph until the new one is indexed and swapped in. A hook that fires on every edit would be
the wrong place to BUILD (a warm rebuild is about a minute); it is the right place to say "something may have changed".
No graph yet: nothing happens here; the first build is `axiomengine index`, or the first query verb."""
