"""What the enrich and changes hooks print about one declaration, where a bare number would mislead.

  zero_label   a method with no resolved caller. Of 323 caller counts the Read / Grep hooks printed in headless
               sessions, 209 were `← 0`, and most of those were methods a framework calls: a route handler, an
               `@app.before_request`, a scheduled job, a library override. The graph stores why for most of them,
               so the line says it: `entry (http)`, `0 resolved, 3 by name`, `? framework (@Scheduled)`. A method
               with no signal at all still reads `0`. The reason is graph_sql.no_caller_reasons, which impact and
               path read too.
  callers_via_base  the callers through an interface or base method, which impact lists and call_edges lacks.
  body_line    an edit that changed only bodies breaks no caller; the one thing worth saying is which tests reach
               it and how to run them. The block it replaces listed 10-42 readers, and 28 of 30 went unused.

Every lookup is one indexed query per declaration (these run on every Read, Grep and Edit)."""
