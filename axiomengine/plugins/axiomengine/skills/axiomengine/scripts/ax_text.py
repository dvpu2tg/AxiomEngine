"""[text]: what a search by hand finds, for a question the graph has no declaration for.

NEVER ANSWER WORSE THAN GREP. A name no graph declares (a message, an environment variable, a key written in a YAML, a
string an issue quotes) was refused with "nothing named X" and nothing else, and the agent asked it then searched the
tree by hand: most of the searches that bypassed the graph were exactly that. The search is cheap and the tool knows
more than grep does about each line it finds: which declaration holds it, or that no graph reads that file at all.

So a refusal now carries the text matches, and every one of them is labelled `[text]`: a line that WRITES the name,
never a call edge, never counted as a caller, and never an exit status of 0 (the verb still refused). The containing
declaration is looked up in every graph of the repository, so a line in another language's file is placed too.

In a repository in several languages every graph refuses on its own (ax_langs.py). A verb that is one of several
(AXIOMENGINE_FANOUT) prints no text block: it writes MARK and what it would have searched for on stderr, and the
dispatcher prints ONE block when no graph answered, instead of the same lines once per language.
