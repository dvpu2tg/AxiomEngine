"""ax_nonsource.py — the text files the index does not read as source, and where a name is written in them, without
opening every one of them on every query.

`impact` looks for the changed name in files the compiler never sees (a mapper XML, a services file, a properties file,
a build script, a spec), because a rename breaks those at run time. It used to find them by walking the tree and
OPENING every candidate file twice per query: once to tell text from binary, once to search it. On this repository that
is ~2,100 files and 0.6 s of every impact query; on a machine whose antivirus scans each open, or on a busy one, the
opens are what the query waits on, and they are the same files every time.

So the scan is kept per graph in <graph>/out/dl/nonsource.sqlite:

  files(rel, size, mtime_ns, kind)   what each candidate file was when it was last read: kind 0 text, 1 binary
  tok(tok, rel)                      the words written in each text file: every maximal run of [\\w.$-] characters,
                                     and each of its prefixes that ends before a '.'

A query still walks the tree (so a new or deleted file is seen at once) and stats every candidate, but opens only a file
whose size or mtime moved since it was read, and searches only the files whose words include a name asked for. A name
can match only at the start of such a run (the search requires no [\\w.$-] before it) and must end where the run ends or
at a '.', which is exactly the set stored, so the files skipped are files the search could not have matched: the answer
is the one the full scan gives. A file modified in the last two seconds is not cached (its mtime may not have ticked
yet); a name with a character outside [\\w.$-] falls back to searching every file; any error with the cache falls back to
the full scan.

# ── which name matches are noise ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Two rules, applied to every hit before anyone sees it (impact's "bound from outside the source", context's text
# bindings):
#
#   OUT OF SCOPE. A shell script or a Datalog file is never analysed, so a name matched inside one is noise by rule:
#   `hits` for a method `hits` was 21 rows, most of them CI scripts and rule comments. An extensionless script is
#   one by its first line (`mvnw`, `gradlew`: `#!/bin/sh`).
#
#   PROSE. A name that is a plain English word (`note`, `export`, `build`, `validate`: lowercase letters only, no `_`
#   and no case boundary) is written as a word in templates, YAML, CI files and comments far more often than as a
#   binding: 261 rows for one Django view, 71 for `note`, a Maven `<phase>validate</phase>` for a Java `validate`.
#   Such a match is kept as a binding only where the line writes it the way code or configuration refers to a
#   callable: called (`note(`), quoted as a value (`"note"`, `'note'`), or qualified with `#`, `::` or `->`
#   (`Owner#note`; a CSS `#note` selector is not one). A dotted `Owner.note` is matched as the qualified name itself and never reaches this rule. The
#   rest are PROSE: counted and grep-able, not listed as places a rename breaks.
