"""What will call a declaration that no call site calls — the registration conventions, in one place.

A handler is handed to a framework as a VALUE: `app.get('/orders/:id', getOrder)`, `background.add_task(send_receipt,
id)`, `setTimeout(flush, 1000)`, `handlers = {"x": handle_x}`. The call then happens inside the framework, or later, or
never, so there is no call site for it anywhere in the graph — and every rule that answers "who uses this method" is
about call sites. The reference the parser recorded is the only evidence there is, and what that reference MEANS is a
convention, which is why it lives here in a table rather than inside a rule.

Both backends read this module, so the Datalog side (the `registration` input facts of dl/impact.dl) and the SQL side
(graph_sql.direct_for_method) cannot drift apart on what counts as a registration.

A route registration is NOT recognised by the verb alone. `get`, `set`, `delete`, `head` and `options` are Map, Set,
Headers, Reflect, URLSearchParams and every cache in this ecosystem, so the site must ALSO carry a string that looks
like a path — one that begins with `/`. That is the discriminator the engine's own TypeScript rules use, and it is
what keeps `cache.get(key)` out of the answer. A declaration handed to anything else is not given a registration
here: the reference alone says it is passed as a value (`valueref` in dl/impact.dl), and naming the receiving call as
one that "calls it where the graph cannot follow" was wrong for every synchronous collection operation (#1166).
"""

ROUTE_VERB = {'get', 'post', 'put', 'patch', 'delete', 'head', 'options', 'trace', 'connect', 'all', 'use', 'route'}
# the verbs that name an HTTP method; `all`, `use` and `route` register or mount without naming one
HTTP_VERB = ROUTE_VERB - {'all', 'use', 'route'}

# A CALLBACK IS NOT RECOGNISED BY THE VERB ALONE, and a curated list of verbs was the wrong instrument.
# The route leg has two independent signals -- an HTTP verb AND a path-shaped literal on the same line -- and it is
# the pair that carries it. The callback leg had one: the name of the method being called, matched against a list
# this file maintained by hand. That list had to grow with every framework in every ecosystem, and it was wrong in
# the common case rather than the rare one. Measured on a JVM framework of ~8,600 files it produced 5,361 rows, of
# which forEach (1347), map (1065), filter (586), find (164), flatMap (150) and sort (61) are synchronous
# collection operations: the callable is invoked on that line, in that thread, before the call returns. Each of
# those rows told the reader "that call receives it and calls it where the graph cannot follow", which is the
# opposite of what the code does -- about two thirds of the leg, stated confidently and backwards.
#
# The evidence a registration needs is that a declaration is handed over AS A VALUE, and the graph already records
# that independently of any name: `valueref` in dl/impact.dl, and `refs` with a callable entity kind here. The
# `registered` rule is a join on that reference, so the verb list was a second gate on top of the real signal, not
# the signal itself -- removing it drops the rows that rested on the name alone and keeps the ones the reference
# carries. Route registrations, decoration keys and value-route registrations are untouched: each of those has a
# second signal that does not come from a hand-written vocabulary.

# the entity kinds a parser gives an identifier that binds to a callable. IMPORT_BINDING is here because a handler is
# usually imported from the module that declares it, and the reference at the registration is then recorded as the
# import binding rather than as a method; an import binding is recorded at the USE, not at the import statement, so
# this does not turn every import line into a dependent.
