"""ax_fresh.py — keep the graph current without anyone running `axiomengine index` (#1305).

The graph is one whole-program solve, so an edit cannot be patched into it file by file: the incremental
part is knowing WHAT changed, cheaply, and rebuilding in the background while every verb keeps reading
the previous graph. Three pieces:

  the file table   every file the language's parser reads (sources and the config it resolves from) with
                   size, mtime and a content hash, recorded by axiomengine-build BEFORE the parser reads
                   anything. Fresh = the same file set, and every stat equal or, where it is not, the hash.
                   No git needed; a checkout, a pull or a rebase shows up like any other edit.
  the worker       one per repository, detached, single-flight under a lock the OS drops if it dies. It
                   waits out a burst of edits, rebuilds with the language / --src / --library of the graph
                   it replaces, and checks again: an edit made DURING the build is caught by the next pass.
  the triggers     hooks (after an edit, a shell command, a turn, at session start, on a prompt) only START
                   the worker and return. Query verbs start it and answer from the previous graph at once, with
                   every row that lies in a file changed since marked (`query`); they wait only when the answer
                   touches such a file and the refresh is expected within a small budget, or when asked (--fresh).

  ax_fresh.py snapshot <repo> <lang> <src>     print the file table (JSON), with what built the graph — axiomengine-build stores it
  ax_fresh.py status <repo> [--json]           fresh | stale (+ the changed files) | building | no graph
  ax_fresh.py kick <repo>                      start the worker if the graph is stale; never waits
  ax_fresh.py wait <repo> [<seconds>]          kick, then wait up to <seconds> for a fresh graph
  ax_fresh.py query <repo> <verb> -- <argv>    run a query verb stale-while-revalidate: marked rows, a wait only when
                                               it matters (#1595)
  ax_fresh.py baseline <repo> [<seconds>]      when HEAD moved, wait for the baseline to follow it (changed, test-impact)
  ax_fresh.py worker <repo>                    the worker itself (what kick detaches)
  ax_fresh.py lock <fd>                        take the build lock on an fd the calling shell holds open
  ax_fresh.py count <dir>                      the source files of each language, walked as the parser walks
  ax_fresh.py chosen <repo>                    the --lang and --src an explicit index chose, which a rebuild keeps

Environment: AXIOMENGINE_NO_REFRESH=1 turns every trigger off; AXIOMENGINE_REFRESH_DEBOUNCE (seconds, default 2)
is the quiet window; AXIOMENGINE_FRESH_WAIT (seconds, default 30) is the most a query whose answer touches an edited file
waits for a refresh expected to finish within it, AXIOMENGINE_FRESH=1 (--fresh) makes it wait for the refresh whatever it
takes, up to AXIOMENGINE_FRESH_MAX (default 600); AXIOMENGINE_BUILD_WAIT
(seconds, default 900) is how long a query that finds no graph waits for a build that is running rather than starting
its own; AXIOMENGINE_NO_GITIGNORE=1 watches (and indexes) directories git ignores."""

# A graph is current when the files it was built from are unchanged AND the axiomengine that built it is the one that
# would build it now. Only the first was checked: after a plugin or engine update, `index` said "graph up to date" and
# every query answered from a graph the previous engine had solved, with the previous rules, until someone deleted
# .axiomengine by hand. So the file table also records what built it (`built_by`), and a difference is a stale graph:
#   engine   a hash of what the engine builds a graph with (its parser, rules, pipeline, launcher), and its version
#   rules    a hash of this plugin's code that shapes the graph and its answers: the query rules (dl/*.dl) and
#            axiomengine-index, which writes the symbols every verb reads
#   impact   IMPACT_VERSION, the version of the facts `impact` exports from the graph
# The engine is found the way axiomengine-build finds it (AXIOMENGINE_ENGINE, the checkout this plugin sits in, the engine
# that built this graph, an `axiomengine` on PATH); when none of those is a built engine it is not compared, since
# `npm root -g` is too slow to ask before every query. Only content counts: an install moved to another directory
# with the same bytes is the same engine.
