"""graph_sql.py — everything the graph is asked, answered in SQL over .axiomengine/out/graph.sqlite.

One module, because there is one question set: what must change with a declaration, what reads or uses it, what it
reaches, which tests reach it, and the chain of calls between two things. The hooks import it; `axiomengine impact`
and `axiomengine path` are being moved onto it.

WHY IT EXISTS. The same answers used to come from Soufflé over 45 relations exported to .facts — 401 MB on a
1.23M-LOC Java bundle. Profiled there with the export already cached, writing the per-query facts was 4.2 s and
Soufflé 18.8 s, and at --depth 1 a query still cost 21 s of 26 s: the transitive closure is a few seconds, and the
rest is carrying the graph across a process boundary and reading it back, once per query. Querying the bundle in
place removes both. Measured over 40 random methods of that bundle: a median 6.94 s, p90 23.8 s and max 30.5 s
became a flat 1.5-2.0 s, and the 19 of 40 that exceeded the edit hook's timeout=14 became none.

CORRECTNESS. Checked against impact.dl as SETS, not counts, on randomly sampled targets: 30 targets over two
bundles (12 on 298k LOC, 18 on 1.23M LOC), 0 disagreements, across the contract, resolved and by-name tiers.
validate/fastimpact_parity.py is that harness and exits non-zero on any set-level disagreement. Comparing sets is
what caught both bugs a counts check would have passed — see the notes on recursion and on display ambiguity below.

WHAT IT DECLINES. A constructor: impact.dl counts who instantiates the type, which is not a call edge, so
answering from call_edges alone under-reported (4 callers as 2). impact() returns None there and the caller falls
back, which is right for that kind.
