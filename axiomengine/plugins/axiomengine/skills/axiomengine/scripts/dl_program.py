"""dl_program.py — a Datalog program compiled to a native binary once, cached by the program's hash.

Every query program goes through here: `dl/impact.dl` (axiomengine-impact), and `dl/path*.dl` (axiomengine-path). The cache
is keyed by the RULES alone (and the machine's platform) and lives in the user's cache,
`${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-~/.cache}/axiomengine/queries/` (AXIOMENGINE_QUERY_CACHE overrides it), beside the engine's own Soufflé
cache. It used to live next to the rules in `dl/.cache/`, inside the plugin: every plugin copy (an update installs a new
versioned directory; a second checkout, a worktree) then recompiled byte-identical rules, 45-140 s for impact.dl alone,
and that was paid by whichever came first, the index or a query (#1606). A binary an older plugin left in `dl/.cache/`
is still used.

A QUERY NEVER WAITS FOR A COMPILE. When the rules are not compiled yet, `program()` starts the compile in the
background (one per program per machine, under a lock) and answers this query with the Soufflé interpreter, which
derives the same relations from the same rules. The interpreter is at most ~2x slower per solve on the graphs measured;
the compile it replaces cost 45 s and more on the first question. `axiomengine index` starts the compiles when the build
starts, in parallel with the engine, so normally they are done before the graph is published.

What this buys is the COMPILE STEP, not query speed: on a 5 MB fact set the binary ran the same program in 1.3 s
against the interpreter's 2.5 s, but on apache/rocketmq (2,265 files, 184k edges) a query took 22.5 s compiled and
19.4 s interpreted — there, loading the facts dominates and the binary wins nothing. Do not quote a speed-up
without saying which graph it was measured on.

Why it must be warmed by `axiomengine index` (`warm()`, called from axiomengine-build) rather than left to the first
query: a caller with a timeout SHORTER than the ~20 s compile kills it every time, so nothing is ever cached and
the next call starts over. `hooks/changes.py` runs impact with `timeout=14` on every Edit — measured on
jackson-databind (1,373 files), 24 of 28 Edit hooks burned the full 14 s and returned "(impact unavailable)",
which was the whole of that benchmark's wall-clock regression. A killed compile leaves no `.nocompile` marker
either (it did not fail, it was killed), so it cannot even record its own defeat.
