"""One vocabulary for the hops a chain is made of.

A chain is printed as hops, and the graph does not have one kind of hop. Five front ends name the
same relation differently, and each one has tiers the others never emit. Counted over one project
per language, `call_edges` carries 11 distinct tiers and 30 distinct kinds:

    java        known_edge multi_inferred ambiguous_unknown boundary_lib ambiguous_anon
                method new ctor_delegate anon_new ref
    typescript  + ambient_terminal intrinsic_terminal FUNCTION_CALL METHOD_CALL CONSTRUCTOR_CALL SUPER_CALL OPTIONAL_CALL
    javascript  + callback_registered implicit_constructor dynamic_terminal fan_capped event_dispatch
                + COMPUTED_CALL IIFE_CALL DYNAMIC_IMPORT_CALL DYNAMIC_CODE_CALL TAGGED_TEMPLATE_CALL
                  FUNCTION_CALL_APPLY FUNCTION_CALL_CALL FUNCTION_CALL_BIND
    python      SIMPLE_CALL METHOD_CALL SELF_CALL SUPER_CALL CHAINED_CALL SUBSCRIPT_CALL CONTEXT_MANAGER
                PROPERTY_READ METACLASS_CREATION DYNAMIC_CALL UNKNOWN_CALLEE_CALL DECORATOR_{APPLICATION,ATTRIBUTE,BARE,CALL}
    csharp      + boundary_generated known_implicit_ctor known_builtin_operator ambiguous_dynamic fan_capped event_dispatch
                  runtime_observed (only with a runtime trace) · new property_read property_write

Two rules hold here, and they are the reason this module exists rather than a dict at the top of
each verb:

  1. EVERY TIER IS LISTED. An unlisted tier used to fall to a default rank that sat BELOW `contains`
     — the synthetic containment hop (`defines`), which is not a call at all. On a JavaScript project 8,916 of
     25,048 traversable edges carry such a tier (`callback_registered`, `event_dispatch`), so the
     chain reader preferred a containment hop to a real registered-callback call on a third of the
     graph. An unrecognised tier now ranks LAST, and says so.

  2. A HOP THAT IS NOT A CALL IS NOT COUNTED AS ONE. `defines` says the callee is written inside
     the caller's body; it runs only after the definer did, which is worth traversing, but "A
     reaches B in 11 calls" is false when five of the eleven are containment. `calls_in()` is what
     a hop count is taken from.

# ── `defines`: a callable written inside another one's body ────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Nobody calls a lambda or an anonymous class's method by name, but it runs only after its definer did, so the walk
# takes the hop. A declaration carries no columns, only a line span, and a span is evidence of containment only when it was
# WRITTEN and is STRICTLY wider. Two spans that were not:
#   · a member the engine synthesises (a Lombok accessor or constructor; id `generated:…`) is given its
#     type's span, so it "contained" every method of the type and each generated
#     accessor defined every other (#1402). No line declares it, so it defines nothing and nothing defines it.
#   · two callables on one line have the same span, and the stack used to push the second as the first's child,
#     in whichever direction their ids sorted (#1399): `modeA() { } modeB() { }`, a one-line record's accessors,
#     a C# `{ get; set; }` pair. On an equal span the only containment the name can vouch for is an anonymous
#     callable inside a named one (`Runnable r() { return new Runnable() { public void run() {…} }; }`,
#     `int f() => xs.Sum(x => x.n);`): it nests under the callable with fewer anonymous scopes in its display.
#     Two at the same depth are siblings.
#   · when a line holds more than one candidate definer (`Runnable a() { return new Runnable() {…}; } Runnable b() {…}`,
#     or an anonymous class inside another's method), the display cannot say which one it sits in: the anon's display
#     names its type, not its method. The call sites can: they carry columns, and the definer is the callable one of
#     whose sites (the `new Runnable() {…}` itself, or the call a lambda is passed to) spans a site of the anon's own.
#     The narrowest such site wins, so an anon inside an anon nests under the inner method, not the outer one. An anon
#     that makes no call has no site to place it by and keeps the stack's answer.
#   · a front end whose qualified names follow the source's own nesting (JavaScript: `keys.outer.<function-expression>`
#     is written inside `keys.outer`, `keys.<arrow>` beside it) says outright which callable on a line holds an
#     anonymous one, with or without a call site: on an equal span it nests only under a callable whose qualified name
#     its own extends. `function first() {…} const xs = [1].map(function (v) {…});` are siblings (#1598). Java, C# and
#     TypeScript name a lambda or an anonymous class after its type, not its method, so there the name says nothing.
# Only these scopes are anonymous. A named constructor or initializer (`<constructor>`, `<primary-constructor>`,
# `<static-init>`, `<clinit>`, `<classbody>`, `<module>`) is a sibling of the methods written beside it.

# ── a STUB SITE: a call written inside a mocking library's stub or verification ─────────────────────────────
# `when(repo.find(id)).thenReturn(x)`, `verify(repo).save(x)`, `mock.Setup(r => r.Find(id))`,
# `sub.Received().Save(x)`, `sub.Find(id).Returns(x)`. The engine resolves `repo.find` to the declared method, which
# is right about the NAME (a rename or a new parameter breaks the test) and wrong about EXECUTION: the receiver is a
# mock, so the real body never runs there. Walked as a call, every stub was a `[sound]` route from the test to the
# real method, and "which tests run this body" was answered with the tests that replace it. Measured on a Spring REST
# project: all 8 tests named for a service method stubbed it on a @MockBean, and none of them ran it.
#
# A site is a stub site by its POSITION against the wrapper's own call site (the parser records both spans), never by
# its own name, and only when the wrapper did NOT resolve to a client declaration: a project method called `when` or
# `Setup` is not the library's. Three shapes, one knob table per language:
#   arg     the stubbed call is the wrapper's ARGUMENT, the outermost call in it: `when(x.m(a()))` marks m and not a(),
#           which runs for real to build the stub's argument; `mock.Setup(x => x.M())` marks M
#   prefix  the wrapper's RESULT is the stubbed call's receiver: `verify(x).m()`, `sub.Received(1).M()`. Mockito's
#           `doReturn(v).when(x).m()` is this shape too, and `when` counts here only behind a do* call, because an HTTP
#           test DSL writes a request as `given().when().get("/orders")` and that `get` is the request, not a stub
#   recv    the stubbed call is the wrapper's RECEIVER: NSubstitute's `sub.M(a).Returns(v)`
# Python has no row on purpose: unittest.mock replaces an attribute by STRING (`patch("pkg.mod.f")`,
# `patch.object(C, "m")`) and a MagicMock receiver is untyped, so no call on a mock resolves to a client method.
