"""The contract every verb answers under. One module so the rules hold everywhere, not per script.

Written after a measured run where an agent asked the graph twice, was handed 492 methods across 67 files
ordered by how many methods each file contained, read three of them and patched one — while the files it
needed sat at ranks 67 and 78, and one was never listed at all. Nothing was missing from the answer. It
was unscoped, unranked, unbounded, and silent about what it could not see.

Five rules, and every verb obeys all five:

  1. SCOPE IS REQUIRED and validated against the graph. A name means different things in different
     packages; answering the wrong twin confidently is worse than refusing. Measured on one task, a scope
     took the right files from 2-of-5 in the top ten to 4-of-5 in the top six.
  2. A REFUSAL ALWAYS CARRIES A CORRECTION. Never a dead end: hand back the paths that exist, ranked by
     how well each matches what was asked. A dead end is what sends an agent back to grep for good.
  3. THE ANSWER IS BUDGETED here, not by the reader. Left unbounded, the caller truncates at an arbitrary
     point and may cut exactly the row that mattered.
  4. RANK BY RELEVANCE, NEVER BY SIZE. Ordering by how many methods a file holds puts the biggest file
     first, which is a property of the file and not of the question. The same rule binds the CORRECTION a
     refusal offers: ranking candidate directories by symbol count put a monorepo's umbrella directory
     above every package inside it, and matching the task's words against a directory's own name promoted
     the package the repository is named after on the strength of the issue's version field.
  5. STATE THE BOUND. Say what the answer cannot see — the relations this graph does not encode — so a
     partial list is not read as a complete one.

    Rule 2 says a refusal always carries a correction. "no graph at …/graph.sqlite — run `axiomengine
    index` first" carries one, and it is still the wrong answer: the correction is a command the
    caller can only run by hand, and running it is the whole of what they wanted. It was the last
    manual step between installing the package and getting an answer out of it.

    It is OFF unless AXIOMENGINE_AUTOBUILD is set, and the dispatcher sets it — so the CLI and the MCP
    server (timeout 900 s) build on demand, while the plugin's hooks, which shell straight to these
    scripts under timeouts of 10-25 s, do not. A first build takes minutes: under a hook it would be
    killed every time, cache nothing, and repeat on the next edit forever.
