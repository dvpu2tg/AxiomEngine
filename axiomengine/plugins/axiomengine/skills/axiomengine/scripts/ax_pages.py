"""Pages and a next step for every verb's prose answer (#1198, #1202).

An agent keeps every answer in its context for the rest of its session, and treats a long answer as a list of
leads: on a question the graph had already answered, a run read six more files following callers an answer
listed. So every verb's prose is

  * PAGED at a fixed budget (~2000 tokens). The answer is still computed in full; every page carries the counts
    of the sections it does not show, the rows come strongest first, and the footer says how many pages are left,
    what they hold and how to ask for them;
  * CLOSED with one `next:` line -- what to read or run now, and what not to spend reads on.

`install(verb)` is one call at the top of a verb's `__main__`: it takes `--page` / `--budget` out of argv,
captures what the verb prints, and on exit writes the answer back paged, with the verb's next step appended when
the verb did not print its own. `--json` is never touched: a consumer parses the whole document.
