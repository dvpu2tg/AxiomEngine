"""ax_langs.py <repo> <verb-script> [args…]  — ask every language's graph, for a repository written in several.

axiomengine-build gives each language its own graph: the main one (most files) at .axiomengine/out/graph.sqlite, as it
always was, and every other at .axiomengine/lang/<lang>/out/graph.sqlite. A graph holds one language and no call is
followed from one to another; what a question needs is that NONE of them is left out. So the verb runs once per graph
(AXIOMENGINE_GRAPH / AXIOMENGINE_GRAPH_LANG name it), all at once, and the answers are put together:

  one graph answers       its answer, as it would be alone (another language's is headed with its name)
  several answer          each, headed with its language, the main one first
  none answers            each graph's refusal, headed, and the main graph's exit status
  --json                  the answering graph's object, as it would be alone; when several answer, the main one's
                          (or the first) with `other_languages`: {<lang>: <that graph's object>} added. A reader that
                          knows one language reads the object it always read.

An answer is exit status 0; a refusal (nothing by that name in this graph) is not. Status 3 is a graph with nothing to
say: `changed` and `test-impact` asked about an edit none of whose files is that graph's language (owner() below). It is
left out of the answer, and when every graph says so the main graph's "no change" is the answer.
