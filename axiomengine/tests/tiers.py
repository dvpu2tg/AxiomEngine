"""tests/tiers.py — every tier the schema documents is one the frontend knows how to rank and label.

`ax_edges.py` ranks a tier it has not been taught LAST and labels it `registered`, which is the honest default
for an edge it cannot name — and the wrong answer for a resolved one. C#'s `known_implicit_ctor` and
`known_builtin_operator` and TypeScript's `intrinsic_terminal` were documented in the schema and missing here,
so nothing failed while every answer that met them read them as the weakest claim. This compares the two
lists, so a tier added to graph/bundle/schema.ts fails here until the frontend is taught it.
