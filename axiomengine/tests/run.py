"""tests/run.py [<case> …] [--lang java|python|typescript|javascript] [--keep] [-v]

What the plugin CLAIMS to find, checked on code that is small enough to read. Each case is a directory under
tests/cases/<language>/<name>/ holding a tiny synthetic project and a case.json:

  {"lang": "java", "src": "src",
   "checks": [{"why":   "a this.field write in an unrelated class is not this field",
               "run":   ["impact", "A.url", "--kind", "field"],
               "want":  ["reads it through url()"],          # substrings that MUST appear
               "avoid": ["B.B", "B.url"]}]}                   # substrings that must NOT appear

The case is indexed once (into its own .axiomengine, removed afterwards unless --keep) and every check is run against
it. A check fails loudly with the line that was wrong, so a regression names itself. No corpus, no network, nothing
outside the case directory.

Three other keys a check may carry:

  "stdout_json": true    STDOUT ALONE must parse as one JSON document. `want` and `avoid` read stdout and stderr
                         CONCATENATED, so no substring can express "this must not be inside the document" — which is
                         how a `note:` line sat in --json for every name declared as both a field and a method.
  "expect_error": true   a non-zero exit is the answer, not a fault (`path` exits 1 when it finds no chain).
  "pending": "<issue>"   the check states behaviour the tool does NOT have yet. It still RUNS. Failing prints PEND and
                         is not a suite failure; PASSING is a failure reading "remove the marker", so a gap that
                         closes cannot keep a marker claiming it is open.

  PENDING IS DECIDED FROM want / avoid MISMATCHES ONLY, NEVER FROM THE EXIT CODE, and that is the property that makes
  it safe rather than dangerous. A marker that absorbed an unexpected non-zero exit would be a hiding place for real
  breakage: both of the defects this suite surfaced on 2026-09-18 were a silent empty answer and an unreadable one,
  and neither announces itself as a want/avoid mismatch. If anyone ever "simplifies" `pending` into a skip, that is
  the property they will have removed.
