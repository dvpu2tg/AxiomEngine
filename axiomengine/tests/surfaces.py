"""tests/surfaces.py — every verb the dispatcher dispatches is documented on every caller-facing surface.

The defect this exists for (#1034): `context` and `test-impact` both worked, both documented themselves
properly under their own `--help`, and appeared on NONE of the surfaces a caller actually looks at. The
cause was three separate hand-maintained lists, none derived from the `case` statement that dispatches.
`axiomengine --help` is now derived from the dispatcher's own comment block, so it cannot drift; SKILL.md
and the MCP server still cannot be, and this is what says so out loud when one of them falls behind.

The fourth surface is `bin/axiomengine` — the command an install actually puts on $PATH (#1107). Every
query verb was implemented, shipped and unreachable from it, and `axiomengine path A B` was silently
taken for a build of a directory called `path`. That surface is checked BY RUNNING IT, not by reading
it: the verb must dispatch, not merely be mentioned.

    python3 tests/surfaces.py

A verb that is deliberately not exposed on a surface goes in EXEMPT with the reason, so the exemption is
a written decision rather than a silent gap.
