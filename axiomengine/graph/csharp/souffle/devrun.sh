# Compile and run the C# engine over one already-extracted IR directory.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM run-souffle.sh: the real executor stages
# libraries, caches binaries, runs the stage<->solve loop and then bundles into
# graph.sqlite. All of that is right for a pipeline run and too slow to iterate a
# rule against. This does the one thing a rule author needs: stage a client IR,
# compile, solve, and drop the raw relations where they can be read.
#
# IT MUST COMPILE, NOT INTERPRET. souffle's interpreter refuses arity beyond a
# built-in limit ("Requested arity not yet supported") and cs_method has 35
# columns, so `souffle -F -D` on this engine aborts with a failed assertion. The
# native path has no such limit, which is why the shared executor compiles too.
#
# Usage: devrun.sh <ir-dir> <work-dir> [relation ...]
#   ir-dir    a directory of all-csharp-*.csv (parser output, flat or per-language)
#   work-dir  scratch: facts/, the binary cache and out/
#   relation  extra relations to .output beyond the export manifest
