Generate graph/csharp/souffle/decls_all.dl from the rules in engine/.

Soufflé needs a .decl for every derived relation, and hand-maintaining ~400 of them
next to the rules that define them is how a relation ends up declared at the wrong
arity: the program still compiles, the join silently matches nothing, and the only
symptom is a recall number that is lower than it should be. So the declarations are
DERIVED from the rules, and CI re-runs this with --check.

TWO THINGS ARE DERIVED, NOT GUESSED:

  ARITY, from the rule heads. A relation whose heads disagree about arity is an
  ERROR rather than a pick between them -- that disagreement is exactly the bug
  this file exists to prevent.

  WHICH COLUMNS ARE `number`. Soufflé will not type a variable that is the result
  of an aggregate or of arithmetic unless the column is declared number, and it
  reports that as "unable to deduce type for variable d" against the rule rather
  than against the declaration. Hand-listing the numeric columns means finding them
  one compile error at a time, so they are inferred from HOW EACH VARIABLE IS USED
  and then propagated to a fixpoint: a column is number if any rule binds it with an
  aggregate, with arithmetic, with to_number or with a number-valued generator
  (range, strlen, ord), or compares it against a numeric
  literal -- or if it is ever unified with a column already known to be number.

  Inference is deliberately narrow. `=` and `!=` between two variables say nothing
  (both are used constantly on hashes), and only a comparison against a literal
  number counts on its own. A column the evidence does not reach stays `symbol`,
  which is the safe default: souffle then reports a real error instead of this file
  inventing a type.

Relations declared in decls_base.dl (the parser's own cs_* / lib_cs_* fact families)
are skipped: they are generated from the parser's schema and are the contract.

Usage:
  python3 gen_decls_all.py            # rewrite decls_all.dl
  python3 gen_decls_all.py --check    # exit 1 if it would change
