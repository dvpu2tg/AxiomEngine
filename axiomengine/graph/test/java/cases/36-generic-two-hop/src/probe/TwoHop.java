 * same variable, resolved only as a direct chain: parking the intermediate in a `var` local
 * lost the binding, because `var` writes no type reference of its own and nothing carried the
 * initializer's type arguments across to the local's uses.
 *
 * Every shape here is client -> library -> client: the element type is the client's own
 * Widget, so a resolved chain ends at probe.Widget#id() and an unresolved one is visible as a
 * declared unknown rather than as a missing row.
