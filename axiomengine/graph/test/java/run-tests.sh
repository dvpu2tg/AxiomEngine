# axiom-code-graph — Java engine regression suite
#
# For every case in test/java/cases/<name>/src:
#   1. parse the source to IR            (external parser, $AXIOM_PARSER)
#   2. solve with the engine             (graph/pipeline/run-souffle.sh)
#   3. COVERAGE GUARD: no call site may vanish silently
#   4. normalize the edges to golden form and diff against test/java/expected/<name>.edges
#   5. CONFIG REPORT: if the case derives any config-resolution rows (beans, DI edges,
#      config bindings, config entry points, declared unknowns), normalize them and diff
#      against test/java/expected/<name>.config
#
# A golden records every edge WITH its status/kind, and also records declared unknowns, so a
# change in resolution power shows up as a reviewable diff instead of a silent shift.
#
#   ./run-tests.sh                 run every case
#   ./run-tests.sh 04 06           run cases matching those substrings
#   ./run-tests.sh --bless         regenerate goldens from the current engine (review the diff!)
#   ./run-tests.sh --oracle        ALSO validate against ground truth built with javac + javap
#                                  (javac + javap invoke instructions — no third-party analyzer):
#                                  every bytecode-declared client->client edge must be present.
#   ./run-tests.sh --keep          keep the per-case work dirs for debugging
#   ./run-tests.sh --no-torture    skip the torture families.
#                                  ONLY for an environment that cannot hold the JVM platform IR.
#                                  The families call java.util.List, Map and the functional
#                                  interfaces, so with the platform absent those receivers are
#                                  unresolvable by construction, and the score measures the staging
#                                  rather than the rules. Excluding them is stated in the output.
#
#   With --oracle, a case carrying a spring-oracle.conf ALSO boots its sources in a real
#   AnnotationConfigApplicationContext and scores bean_def / di_edge against what Spring
#   itself resolved (tools/spring_oracle.sh + spring_oracle_diff.py). That report is
#   pinned as expected/<name>.spring-oracle, so a precision or recall change fails.
#
# expected/<case>.known-missing   accepted gaps (one edge per line, # comments allowed). A NEW
#                                missing edge fails; a known one that starts working ALSO fails, so
#                                the debt list cannot silently rot.
#
# Environment:
#   AXIOM_PARSER   path to the parser entrypoint   (default parser/dist/index.js — the parser in this repository)
#   AXIOM_SUITE_JOBS  cases run at once (default: the CPU count; 1 = one at a time, output uncaptured)
#
# NO EXTERNAL LIBRARY IR IS USED OR REQUIRED — see the note above the EMPTY_LIB line. A case
# may however ship its own lib-src/ STUB library (kilobytes, in the repo), which is extracted
# and passed as --library so the client->library hand-off can be exercised at all.

# CLIENT -> CLIENT ONLY. This suite NEVER stages a library IR — not the JDK, not
# anything else. Two reasons:
#   1. A library IR is ~2 GB and cannot live in the repo, so any test that needed one
#      would be unrunnable for anybody who clones this project.
#   2. What these cases pin down is the engine's resolution of the CLIENT's own code:
#      overload selection, dispatch, shadowing, nesting, config/DI wiring. A library
#      boundary edge tests the library IR, not the rules.
# A call into a library therefore resolves to nothing and is recorded as
# ambiguous_unknown — which is the honest answer for a client-only analysis, and the
# coverage guard still proves the site was not silently dropped.
