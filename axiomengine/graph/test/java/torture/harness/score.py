"""Per-FAMILY coverage for the Java torture project, against the class-file oracle.

Why per family and not one number: an aggregate that says "94%" tells you nothing about WHICH
construct is unsupported, and a construct is what a fix is written against. Every file here is one
family, every caller's type carries the family's prefix, so an edge attributes itself.

Verdicts, per family:
  found    the oracle's edge is in the graph
  precise  the engine named a SUBTYPE of the bytecode owner — the method that actually runs.
           Bytecode records the receiver's STATIC type, so `Base b = new Unit(); b.area()` is
           recorded as Base#area while the engine, having flow-typed the variable, answers
           Unit#area. Neither is wrong, and folding it into `missed` would report the engine as
           having lost an edge at exactly the moment it got sharper.
  ancestor the engine named a SUPERTYPE — where the method is declared. Also not an error.
  missed   nothing of that signature anywhere in the receiver's hierarchy — bytecode's declared
           targets are facts, so this is a defect
  wide     an edge the engine emits that the oracle does not. Where dispatch is genuinely ambiguous
           the engine emits the SOUND SET, so a superset is expected; it is reported, never failed,
           and it must not grow unnoticed, which is what the golden is for.

The oracle cannot see everything the source contains, and that is a property of bytecode rather
than of the engine: an annotation is not an invoke instruction, so f05 has almost no bytecode-
visible edges at all. Its coverage is scored from the CONFIG relations instead, which is where an
annotation's meaning lands.
