# JAVA TORTURE — ten families of construct, graded against the class-file oracle.
#
# The 30-odd cases in test/java/cases each pin ONE rule. This asks a different question: given a
# project written to use everything the language offers at once, how much of it does the graph
# actually contain, and WHICH construct is the gap. A single percentage cannot answer the second
# half, so every file is one family and the score is per family.
#
# Ground truth is the client's own compiled bytecode, read with java.lang.classfile — the same
# reader the corpus-scale harness uses. The client is compiled AGAINST the stub library rather than
# with it, so `dep.*` is genuinely external and the client->library hand-off is a boundary.
