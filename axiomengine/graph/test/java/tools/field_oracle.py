"""GROUND TRUTH FOR FIELD ACCESS, FROM THE JDK ITSELF — no third-party analyzer.

The sibling of tools/bytecode_oracle.py, reading the FIELD instructions instead of the invoke
instructions: `getfield`, `getstatic`, `putfield`, `putstatic` out of `javap -p -v`. Those four
opcodes ARE the answer to "who reads or writes this field" — every bytecode tool extracts the same
thing — and the only dependency is the JDK, so the reference cannot be contaminated by another
analyzer's resolution choices. Anybody can audit a row with javap by hand.

Emitted form, one line per (caller, field, direction):

    Caller#name(params) READ  Owner#field
    Caller#name(params) WRITE Owner#field

`readwrite` is NOT a bytecode concept: `f += 1` compiles to a getfield and a putfield, so the
oracle emits both rows and the engine's single `readwrite` row is scored as satisfying both. The
scorer (tools/score_fields.py) does that expansion; this file stays a literal reading of the
instructions.

CONVENTIONS, identical to bytecode_oracle.py so the two are directly comparable:
  * nested types named by their dotted chain, `pkg.Outer.Inner`
  * anonymous classes keyed by SUPERTYPE (`Outer$anon:Runnable`); an enum-constant body folds
    back to the ENUM
  * a local class's javac index is stripped (`Outer$1Local` -> `Local`)
  * a lambda body folds into the method that lexically contains it, params `*`, taken from the
    invokedynamic site that references it
  * the OWNER is re-pointed to the class that DECLARES the field (bytecode names the receiver's
    static type, and a field is not virtual, so the declaring class is the storage location)

EXCLUDED, because the source contains no such access — the same principle as the lowering
exclusions in bytecode_oracle.py, and each one is a construct the compiler writes, not the author:
  * `this$0`, `this$1`, … the synthetic outer-instance link of an inner class
  * `val$x` the synthetic capture of a local by an inner/anonymous class
  * `$assertionsDisabled`, `$VALUES`, `$SwitchMap$…`, `$SWITCH_TABLE$…` compiler scaffolding
  * any field carrying ACC_SYNTHETIC in its own declaration
  * a field access inside a synthetic method (access$N, a bridge), except a lambda body
  * an ACCESS THROUGH A SYNTHETIC ACCESSOR is folded into the method that wrote it. javac routes
    a read of a PRIVATE member of a nested class from its enclosing (or sibling) class through a
    generated `access$N`, so the getfield sits in a synthetic method the source does not contain
    and the real caller has no field instruction at all. The same convention the lambda body
    already uses: the access is re-attributed to every method that invokes the accessor.
  * `<clinit>` and `<init>`: OPTIONAL, and off by default. A field INITIALIZER is compiled into
    one of them and the IR attributes it to the enclosing TYPE rather than to a method, so the
    two sides name the caller differently for a reason that has nothing to do with this issue.
    `--with-initializers` keeps them and names the caller `Class#<clinit>()` / `Class#<init>(...)`.

A COMPILE-TIME CONSTANT IS NOT VISIBLE HERE AT ALL. `static final int N = 32;` is inlined at
every use (JLS 13.1), so the class file holds a `ConstantValue` attribute and no getstatic
anywhere. The source reads the field; the bytecode cannot say so, and scoring an engine that
reports the read as a false positive would be scoring the compiler. `--inlined-out <path>`
writes the `Owner#field` list of every such field so the scorer can drop those accesses from
BOTH sides rather than charge one of them.

A CONSTRUCTOR's parameters are rewritten by javac in two cases, and both are undone so the caller
reads as it is written: an ENUM's gets the constant's name and ordinal prepended (`Method(boolean)`
is compiled as `<init>(String,int,boolean)`), and an INNER class's gets the enclosing instance
(`CleaningVisitor(Element,Element)` becomes `<init>(Cleaner,Element,Element)`). An inner class is
identified by its synthetic `this$N` field, which is what carries that instance.
