"""COVERAGE GUARD — the invariant that catches silent drops.

Every invocation-shaped expression in the IR (METHOD_INVOCATION, OBJECT_CREATION,
ANONYMOUS_CLASS_CREATION, METHOD_REFERENCE, CONSTRUCTOR_INVOCATION) must appear as FromExpr in
call-chain-edges.csv — resolved, or explicitly flagged ambiguous. A site that appears NOWHERE was
dropped silently, which is the one failure mode a golden-file diff cannot see (you cannot notice an
absence you never recorded). Exit 1 if any site is missing.

ONE KIND IS EXCLUDED, DELIBERATELY AND VISIBLY: an ARRAY_CONSTRUCTOR method reference (`T[]::new`)
allocates an array and calls nothing, so call-edge-generation/call_chain.dl leaves it out of
invocation_site on purpose — "they resolve as array creation, not a call". Counting it here made
the guard report a drop for a construct the rules had decided is not a site, on every project that
writes `toArray(T[]::new)`, which is most of them. The count is PRINTED rather than silently
dropped: an exclusion nobody can see is one nobody can check, and this guard exists because one
was invisible. Every other method-reference kind is still required to appear.
