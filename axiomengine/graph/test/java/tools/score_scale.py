"""Score the engine's client->client edges against the JDK ClassFile-API oracle, at corpus scale.

Reports, per SCORING.md §4 and §7:
  * conservation (silent drops) — read from the coverage guard, separately
  * P, recall vs CERTAIN (G_lb), recall vs POSSIBLE (G_ub), F1, MCC
  * every FP split into SOUND (inside G_ub) vs FABRICATED (outside it) — the number that matters
  * the missing-edge census, grouped so a mechanism is visible instead of a list

Both sides are restricted to the same caller scope, and the scope is printed, because an exclusion
nobody can see is one nobody can check.

# `it` is NOT in the list. It is a real, widely-shipped Java package root (the top level of every

# src/test/java-gates/source-walk.ts pins `it` under MUST_SURVIVE for exactly this reason. The
# cost of leaving it out is a Maven `src/it/java` integration-test tree now being scored; the
# file-name half below still catches the usual `*IT.java` naming, and scoring a few extra real
# methods is the safe direction next to silently dropping a whole package.

    A CONSTRUCTOR callee is compared at name level too. It used to be dropped from the engine's
    answer and kept in the oracle's — the comment said "excluded on BOTH sides" and only one side
    did it — so every explicitly written `new` was scored missing, and the missing-edge census was
    topped by a cluster that was entirely an artefact. It is now SCORED rather than excluded: the
    reason for excluding it was that the two oracle readers disagreed about which `<init>` is
    javac-synthesized, and expected/oracle-agreement.txt now records that disagreement as zero.
    Only its parameter list is uncomparable, because javac gives a constructor parameters the
