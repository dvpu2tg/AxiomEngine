"""Normalize <out>/call-chain-edges.csv into a stable, reviewable golden form.

One line per edge:    <status>\t<kind>\tCaller#name(params) -> Callee#name(params)
sorted, deduplicated. Hashes are resolved to names so a golden file is human-reviewable and is
NOT sensitive to hash churn.

CONVENTIONS (deliberate, not defects):
  * NESTED TYPES ARE NAMED BY THEIR CHAIN. `package p; class A { class B {} }` yields owners `p.A`
    and `p.A.B`, the IR's qualifiedName form (a local class is `p.A.Local`, without javac's index).
  * ANONYMOUS classes are keyed by their SUPERTYPE (`Outer$anon:Runnable`), because javac and the
    engine number anonymous classes differently — numbering would make goldens brittle.
  * TYPE VARIABLES are erased to their bound (default Object), so `add(E)` reads `add(Object)`.
  * CLIENT -> CLIENT ONLY by default. No library IR is staged for most cases, so a call into a
    library resolves to nothing and is emitted with target `-` as ambiguous_unknown. Declared
    unknowns are part of the golden (a silently dropped site can never look "expected").
  * A case that ships a STUB LIBRARY passes its IR as a third argument, and library callees are
    then named the same way client ones are. Without it a boundary edge reads as an opaque
    <unresolved:HASH>, which makes the golden churn on every parser change that moves a hash —
    the exact brittleness the name resolution above exists to prevent.
