# A BUILD THAT PRODUCED NO IR MUST NOT STAMP ITSELF CURRENT.
#
# build-jdk-ir.sh writes `.parser-revision` only when nothing failed, and a module counted "empty
# (module-info only)" is deliberately not a failure. So a run in which EVERY module came back empty
# wrote the finished stamp and exited 0: an empty tree asserting it is a complete build, with
# `--check` reporting UP TO DATE. A harness pointed at it stages no platform library and cannot
# even print its own "no platform IR" warning, because the directory exists and looks current.
#
# The way that was hit is a symlinked `share/classes` -- which is how src.zip gets staged into the
# `<mod>/share/classes` shape the script documents -- because `find` does not descend into a
# symlinked start path without `-L`. Both halves are asserted here: that the symlinked module is
# actually built, and that a genuinely empty tree fails instead of stamping. See issue #249.
