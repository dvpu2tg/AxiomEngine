# THE CI GATE. Silently-dropped call sites must be ZERO.
#
# This is separated from the rest of the suite because it is the one invariant a
# golden diff structurally cannot check: you cannot notice the absence of
# something that was never recorded. A golden file full of correct edges is
# perfectly consistent with an engine that quietly discards every construct it
# does not understand — and that engine reports excellent precision.
#
# It is also the check that must survive a red suite. While the rule set is being
# written, goldens churn and scores move; "no site vanished" does not, so it can
# be enforced from the first rule onwards.
#
# Exits non-zero if ANY case drops a site, or if the frozen ground truth is
# missing, stale or tampered with.
#
#   ./ci-conservation.sh            all cases
#   ./ci-conservation.sh 04 05      only matching cases
