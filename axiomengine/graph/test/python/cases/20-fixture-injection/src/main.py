"""Fixture injection: a test's PARAMETER NAME is the call.

A test runner collects `def test_total(cart)`, looks `cart` up among the declared
fixtures, calls the fixture, and passes the result in. The parameter name is the
only thing joining the two; there is no call site, so "which tests reach this
helper" -- the question test-impact exists to answer -- stops at the fixture.

The hop matters most in the direction nothing else covers: a fixture BODY calls
production code, so a test reaches that code only through the injection.

THE NEGATIVE HALF IS THE POINT. A parameter matches a fixture by name, and names
are cheap. A parameter with a DEFAULT is supplied by the caller, not injected; a
non-test function taking `cart` is not a test; and a fixture name that no test
requests must not be wired to an unrelated def that happens to share the name.
