"""TIER 1 -- the call-site inventory, from `dis`. Parses; never imports.

WHAT THIS TIER ANSWERS: did the engine see every call, with the right name and
shape? It does NOT answer which method a name means -- bytecode cannot say.
Disassembling `x.run() + Base().run()` yields two indistinguishable
`LOAD_METHOD run`; Python resolves attributes at runtime, so the compiled form
records no target because there isn't one yet.

That makes this tier the CONSERVATION oracle: a call happened here, spelled this
name, so the engine must have emitted a site for it. A site the engine never
emitted is a silent drop, and no golden diff can see the absence of something
that was never recorded.

Uses `compile()` + recursive `co_consts` walk rather than `python -m dis` output
parsing: same guarantees, structured, no subprocess. Verified property of both --
a file whose top level prints and imports a nonexistent package disassembles
cleanly, while importing it fires the side effect and raises. That is what makes
tiers 1-2 cover 100% of files in a corpus that cannot be imported at all.

CALLEE ATTRIBUTION IS BY STACK SIMULATION, not by "the most recent LOAD".
A call's arguments sit between the callee and the call opcode, so nearest-load is
wrong the moment an argument is itself a name: the callee slot for
`decorate(self.kind, self.value)` comes out as `kind`. The simulation tracks what
pushed each stack slot and reads the callee from the exact slot the opcode
consumes. (Adapted from parser-oracle/python/gates/emit_bytecode_calls.py, which
this harness deliberately reuses rather than reinventing; the addition here is
CALLER attribution and shared normalisation.)
