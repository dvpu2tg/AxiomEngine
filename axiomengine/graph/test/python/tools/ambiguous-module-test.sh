# A NAME THAT NAMES TWO MODULES MUST BE REPORTED, NOT RESOLVED SILENTLY.
#
# Library linking joins on QUALIFIED NAME by design — a hash minted by one parse cannot
# match another's — so two modules sharing a name make the join ambiguous and it picks up
# both. That happens WITHIN a tree (a directory that is not a package contributes no
# segment, so alpha/tasks.py and beta/tasks.py are both `tasks`) and ACROSS `--library`
# roots (two independently parsed trees may each hold a `foo`). Neither is a parser defect:
# whether the naming is right depends on how the tree is used, which the parser cannot know.
#
# So the engine owns the other half — NOTICE it. Measured over five open-source projects:
# 38 duplicated module qualified names covering 83 module rows, and on one project 74
# imports of a single name that names FIVE different files, every one resolving to the
# union of all five with nothing saying so. See issue #89.
#
# THIS IS ASSERTED HERE AND NOT AS A CASE because a case compares .edges and .tiers only,
# so a diagnostic EXPORT would be invisible to it — the suite would be green whatever these
# relations said. The controls are the point: an unambiguous tree must produce EMPTY
# exports, or a relation that fires on everything would pass check 1 just as well.
