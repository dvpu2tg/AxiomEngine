# THE DEBT LIST MUST BE RECONCILED IN BOTH DIRECTIONS, OR IT IS NOT A GATE.
#
# oracle_check.py used to fail on ANY missing edge, with no way to record an accepted one. A
# miss is a COVERAGE number, not a defect like a fabrication or a dropped site — so the gate
# could only be green at 100% recall, which for a case named 12-blind-spots is never, and
# `--oracle` was permanently red. Nobody ran it, which cost the only check that compares the
# engine against CPython's own answers. See issue #264.
#
# expected/<case>.known-missing fixes that, and the SECOND direction is what keeps it honest:
# a listed edge that starts resolving must also fail, or the list rots into a record of things
# that were fixed long ago and the gate quietly stops asserting anything. Same discipline as
# test/java's known-missing.
#
# All three failure directions are asserted here by perturbing the list — not the engine — so
# the test needs no engine change and cannot be satisfied by a golden re-bless.

# that usually skips is the defect this area keeps producing (#196, #224, #254).
