# A WIDE PROTOCOL EDGE IS REPORTED, EVEN THOUGH IT IS KEPT.
#
# dispatch_cap bounds a call site by gating expr_resolves_to_method. The three protocol
# edges — a property read, a context manager, an iteration — reach the output from
# expr_type directly and never pass through it, so one of them can commit past a bound
# every written call obeys. This fixture is that asymmetry in one file: ONE receiver
# widened over 31 constructed subclasses, read twice.
#
#   widened.tag()   refused, dispatch_cap_exceeded, 32 reported in dispatch-dropped-by-cap
#   widened.meta    32 getters emitted, and until #371 reported NOWHERE
#
# 32 and not 31: `same()` DECLARES `-> Base`, so declared_dispatch widens over the 31
# constructed subclasses AND the declared base itself, which is what makes this an
# ordinary widening rather than a contrivance.
#
# The sets are kept, deliberately and on measurement: over five open-source projects the
# call cap refuses NOTHING (0 sites of 490,130 exceed it) while 492 protocol slots do, so
# extending it would import a bound doing no work into the one place it would cost 10,776
# sound edges, all on held-out projects. What was wrong was the SILENCE, and that is what
# this asserts.
#
# THE CONTROLS ARE THE POINT. A narrow protocol read must report nothing, or a relation
# true of everything would pass check 2 just as well; and the call arm must still be
# refused, or the fixture would be measuring nothing about the asymmetry at all.
