"""Refuse a string literal in a rule body that is not a declared language or schema fact.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The engine is developed against a handful of codebases, a small sample of
the Python that exists. A rule keyed on a literal drawn from one of them would score well
on every measurement in this repo and generalise to nothing. Nothing else would catch it:
in a rule body, a literal encoding a language fact and a literal copied out of one project
look identical.

WHAT IS ALLOWED, and why each category is safe:

  IR enum values            e.g. "ATTRIBUTE_ACCESS", "METHOD_PARAM" -- these come from the
                            parser's schema. Recognised by shape (SCREAMING_SNAKE).
  provenance                "client" / "lib" -- assigned by which fact file a row is staged
                            into, not by anything in the source.
  confidence tiers          "known_edge", "multi_inferred", "boundary_lib",
                            "ambiguous_unknown" -- the engine's own output vocabulary.
  diagnostic labels         "no_rule", "escape_hatch", ... These are OUTPUT arguments of
                            call_unresolvable / site_reason / expr_type_untypable and are
                            never matched against input, so they cannot bias resolution.
  catalogue members         Anything declared as a one-argument fact in a catalogue —
                            resolution/builtins.dl for a CPython fact, config-resolution/knobs.dl
                            for a framework name
                            (py_builtin_callable, builtin_method_returns, dict_lookup_method,
                            builtin_container_alias, ...). These ARE language facts, they are
                            reviewable as a list in one file, and builtin_method_returns is
                            generated from CPython by introspection rather than written out.
  structural scaffolding    "", "-", ".", the CSV booleans, label prefixes ("lib:",
                            "builtin:", "external:"), and small numerals.

Anything else fails. The fix is to move it into a catalogue with a justification, or to
remove it -- not to extend this allowlist casually.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER. A rule whose SHAPE is fitted to one codebase without naming
anything is the subtler form of the same risk, and no literal check can see it. The
mitigations there are the A/B across every measured codebase, and rejecting a change that
gains on a fixture but nothing on real code.
