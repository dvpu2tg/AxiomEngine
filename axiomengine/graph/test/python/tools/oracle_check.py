"""Validate a case against the FROZEN CPython ground truth, and score the engine.

FOUR THINGS HAPPEN HERE, in this order, and each can fail independently:

  1. MANIFEST -- every lock matches its recorded digest. Editing a lock in place
     to turn a red check green breaks this, and this repo cannot rewrite the
     manifest: only `bin/freeze.py` in the harness can.
  2. FRESHNESS -- the fixture on disk is the fixture the lock was frozen from.
     Editing a case without re-freezing scores new code against an old answer,
     which is worse than no test.
  3. DRIFT -- rebuild the oracle from CPython right now and compare with the
     lock. A difference means the INTERPRETER or the HARNESS changed, not the
     engine. Reporting it as an engine failure would send someone hunting a bug
     that is not there.
  4. SCORE -- if engine edges were supplied, score them. Per construct group,
     with conservation, and with fabrication kept separate from
     over-approximation.
  5. ACCEPTED GAPS -- reconcile the missing edges against
     expected/<case>.known-missing, in both directions: an unlisted miss fails,
     and a listed edge that starts resolving fails too. Conservation and
     fabrication stay absolute; a miss is coverage, not a defect.

Steps 1-3 need no engine at all, which is what makes the ground truth
independently checkable while the rule set is still being written.
