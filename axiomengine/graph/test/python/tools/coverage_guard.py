"""COVERAGE GUARD -- the invariant a golden diff structurally cannot check.

Every call site the parser recorded must appear in the engine's output: resolved,
or explicitly flagged ambiguous. A site that appears NOWHERE was dropped
silently, and you cannot notice the absence of something that was never recorded
-- so this is asserted separately and fails the case on its own.

TWO INDEPENDENT INVENTORIES ARE CHECKED, because they fail differently:

  1. the IR's own `all-python-call-sites.csv` -- did the ENGINE drop a site the
     PARSER found?
  2. tier 1 of the CPython oracle -- did the PARSER drop a site CPython's own
     compiler emitted? A site missing from the IR is invisible to check 1, since
     check 1's denominator is the IR itself. This is the check that catches a
     parser-level gap masquerading as an engine that "handled everything".

CHECK 2 WAS DORMANT UNTIL #224, in three independent ways: it was gated on an
`--oracle` flag the suite never passed, its findings never reached the exit status
(`return 1 if absent else 0` read only check 1), and its denominator counted calls
no author wrote. It now runs on every invocation, fails the case, and is scored on
a denominator that can be believed. It needs no external checkout -- the tier-1
machinery is the vendored copy in tools/vendor.

FOUR CORRECTIONS THE DENOMINATOR NEEDED, each measured rather than assumed:

  IMPLICIT SITES are excluded. `class X:` compiles to a call to __build_class__ and
  a comprehension to an immediately-invoked code object; neither is a call the
  author wrote and neither has an IR counterpart. tier1_sites.Site exposes this as
  `.implicit`, for exactly this purpose, and reading it removes what used to
  dominate the output.

  SENTINEL CALLEES are unadjudicable, not gaps. `via` UNKNOWN and CALL_RESULT carry
  an empty name or `<call-result>` (for `f()()`) -- there was no LOAD to read -- so
  they can never match an IR row. Counting them as misses made CALL_RESULT the
  largest apparent gap on four of five corpora. Same split oracle_check.py already
  makes with its `unver` column: a comparison that cannot be made is not a failure.

  THE KEY IS (file, callee name), NOT (file, line). CPython attributes each
  LOAD_METHOD in a fluent chain to the line the method NAME sits on, so
  `sess.query(P).order_by(...)` split over three lines has sites in both
  inventories at different lines. Line-keying alone put one project at 96.7% with
  nothing missing.

  DECORATORS AND MANGLED NAMES are credited. `@lru_cache` is a real call the author
  wrote, recorded in all-python-decorators.csv rather than in the call-site table;
  a CLASS decorator carries pyTypeLinkHash with an EMPTY pyMethodLinkHash, so
  anchoring through the method FK alone drops every one. And CPython mangles
  `self.__x()` to `_Class__x` while the parser records it as written.

FILE SCOPE IS TAKEN FROM THE IR, NOT HARDCODED. #224 proposes reusing
ir_audit.EXCLUDED_DIRS, but that is only right when the IR was built with
excludeTests=true, and this suite passes false -- a fixed list would then exclude
files the IR does contain and hide real gaps. Instead a tier-1 site is scored only
if its file has a module row, and a file with sites and NO module row is reported
as its own gap class unless the parser listed it in skipped-python-files.csv. That
is exact, self-adjusting, and catches the file-level drop a directory list would
mask.

usage: coverage_guard.py <IR-dir> <OUT-dir> <SRC-dir> [--oracle]
       --oracle is accepted and ignored; check 2 always runs.

def _written_calls_by_line(src):
    """line -> the callee NAMES of the call expressions the source writes there (#304, #372).

    What this is really for is the complement: a tier-1 site whose callee name is not among
    the names written on its line is a call the parser cannot have dropped, because there
    was never one of that name there to mint. Tier 1 reads bytecode, so it still reports
    it — CPython compiles protocol calls the author never wrote — and check 2 counted every
    one as a parser gap. Measured when this was first added: 123 invented gaps across five
    projects, the guard red on all of them while the parser's inventory was complete.

    WHY THIS IS A PROPERTY OF THE LINE AND NOT A LIST OF STATEMENT KINDS, which is the
    change in #372. The first version collected `with` and `for` HEADER lines, on a
    measurement that read `__exit__` out of the class:

        with lock: (on exit)  -> EMPTY callee, via UNKNOWN    already filtered

    True of a `with` whose body falls off the end, and false the moment the body leaves by
    another route: the exit call is then compiled onto the departing statement, and tier 1
    names it after whatever that statement loads. Measured on the pinned interpreter:

        return data          -> callee `data`  via LOCAL      the RETURN line
        return obj.value     -> callee `value` via ATTRIBUTE  the RETURN line
        continue             -> callee `items` via LOCAL      the enclosing FOR line

    and `break` produces nothing at all. Enumerating those would be three more clauses and
    the next control-flow shape a fourth, so the test is the property they share instead.

    KEYED ON THE NAME, NOT ONLY THE LINE, because the two coexist. `with suppress(...):
    return codecs.lookup(enc).name` puts the exit call on a line that also holds a real
    written call: keyed on the line alone that whole line goes unadjudicable and the real
    call stops being checked, and keyed on the name only the exit call does. Measured over
    three projects — 25 invented gaps by line, 3 by name, with the credited count identical
    on all three, so the extra suppression costs no coverage.

    THE SPAN, NOT THE START LINE. A call written across several lines has its Call node at
    the line of the callee, and an argument two lines down is inside the same expression;
    keying on `lineno` alone would leave those interior lines uncovered.

    THIS SUPPRESSES GAPS, so the risk is suppressing a true one, and the containment is
    that a call the parser dropped is still IN THE SOURCE — its name is on its line here,
    whatever the parser did with it. A bare decorator is the one application that is not an
    ast.Call, so it is added explicitly rather than left to fall in the complement. The
    caller also reaches this only after the name-credit test, so a name the IR has anywhere
    in the file never gets here.
