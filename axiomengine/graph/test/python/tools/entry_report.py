"""The per-case ENTRY POINT golden — the relation .edges and .tiers cannot see.

WHY IT NEEDS ITS OWN GOLDEN. An entry point is a declaration NOTHING CALLS: a route
handler the framework invokes on a request. It therefore contributes no edge, and
`.edges` and `.tiers` are both blind to it by construction. Losing the relation, or
gaining a wrong member, would not move either file.

WHAT A WRONG MEMBER COSTS. The claim is "a framework invokes this, so no client call
site reaches it". Asserted of something ordinary it is a fabrication with no call edge
to contradict it — and the first version of the rule made exactly that mistake:
`patch` is an HTTP method AND the stdlib's mock entry point, so `@mock.patch(...)`
was marked a live HTTP route, 229 times across five real projects. Case
16-route-entry-points carries that shape on purpose; if it ever appears here, the
second condition has been lost.

Hashes are resolved to qualified names and paths to basenames, so the golden is
reviewable and survives a rebuild on another machine.
