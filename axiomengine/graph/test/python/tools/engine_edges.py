"""Fold the ENGINE's answer into the same shape as the oracle's.

SYMMETRY IS THE ENTIRE POINT OF THIS FILE. Every fold applied to the CPython side
-- decorators onto the `def` line, comprehension scopes into their parent, module
scope onto line 0, bound methods onto their function -- is applied here too, by
importing `callchain_oracle.normalize` rather than by reimplementing it. An
asymmetry between the two sides manufactures defects that look exactly like
engine bugs, and they are the most expensive kind to chase because the engine is
innocent.

Reads:
  <ir>/all-python-methods.csv     method hash -> filePath, startLine, methodKind
  <ir>/all-python-call-sites.csv  the call-site inventory the parser produced
  <out>/call-chain-edges.csv      the engine's edges, 7 columns:
                                    site, caller, calleeProv, callee, prov, status, kind

Emits, per --mode:
  pairs    caller-anchor <TAB> callee-anchor      (client -> client only)
  sites    file:line, one per call site the engine ACCOUNTED FOR (any status)
  golden   status <TAB> kind <TAB> caller -> callee, sorted -- the reviewable form
