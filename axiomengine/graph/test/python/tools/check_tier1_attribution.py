"""TIER-1 CALLEE ATTRIBUTION — assert the ground truth names the right callee.

WHY THIS EXISTS AND WHY IT IS SEPARATE FROM check_vendor.py. check_vendor asserts
the vendored copies are IDENTICAL to the harness. It cannot say whether either is
CORRECT, and tier 1 is the ground truth every other Python check is scored
against: `dis` decides what a call site is and who it calls. A defect here is not
an engine bug that a golden catches, it is a wrong expectation that every golden
then agrees with.

THE DEFECT THIS PINS. tier1_sites walks instructions LINEARLY and models the stack
with dis.stack_effect. Called without `jump=`, stack_effect returns the MAXIMAL
effect over both branches of a conditional jump, and for the short-circuit opcodes
the two differ:

    JUMP_IF_TRUE_OR_POP    jump path 0   fall-through -1   maximal 0
    JUMP_IF_FALSE_OR_POP   jump path 0   fall-through -1   maximal 0

A linear walk follows the fall-through, so the maximal effect leaves one extra
value on the modelled stack per `or` / `and` operand, and `stack[-consumed]` then
reads an ARGUMENT instead of the callee. Measured on two open-source projects
before the fix: 1,898 of 35,853 sites (5.29%) and 1,101 of 28,719 (3.83%) named
the wrong callee. `bool(self.a or self.b or self.c)` reported `b`.

IT MATTERED MOST WHERE IT WAS HARDEST TO SEE. callchain_oracle/build.py gates the
tier-3-vs-tier-4 cross-check on the callee name agreeing, and `continue`s when it
does not — so a misattributed name makes the oracle SKIP its own self-check, the
one bin/freeze.py refuses to freeze a lock past. The site COUNT was always right
(sites == CALL opcodes, exactly), so conservation never noticed.

WHY NO FIXTURE CAUGHT IT: none of the twelve cases, neither whole-project fixture
and none of the torture families contains a short-circuit operator inside a call's
argument list. The frozen locks are unchanged by the fix, which is the proof.

INTERPRETER-DEPENDENT, AND IT MUST NOT PASS VACUOUSLY. JUMP_IF_TRUE_OR_POP and
JUMP_IF_FALSE_OR_POP were REMOVED in 3.12, where `a or b` compiles to
COPY / POP_JUMP_IF_TRUE / POP_TOP whose stack effects are unconditional. So this
check cannot fail on 3.12 — running it there and reporting "ok" would be a green
tick for a defect that is live on the interpreter the oracle is PINNED to. The
first version of this file did exactly that: it passed against the unfixed copy
under python3.12 and only reproduced under python3.10, 5 of 7 sites wrong. It now
refuses rather than passes when the opcodes are absent, and run-tests.sh invokes
it with $PY (AXIOM_PY_PYTHON, default python3.10).

    # The same misattribution as the short-circuit shapes above, through a different
    # opcode pair: POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE / JUMP_FORWARD. Both arms push one value and only
    # one runs, so a LINEAR walk sees two and the callee slot reads an argument --

    # THE CALL IS FOLLOWED BY MORE CODE, and that is load-bearing. Measured on 3.10:
    # when a conditional expression sits immediately before a `return`, the compiler
    # emits NO JUMP_FORWARD -- it duplicates the whole continuation into both arms and
    # clears the stack between them. That produces an extra site with an EMPTY callee
    # rather than a wrong one: a different defect, harmless to the gap count because

    # ── THE RETURN FORM: ONE WRITTEN CALL, COMPILED TWICE (#324) ─────────────
    # The counterpart to the four above, and a different defect. With the conditional
    # immediately before a `return`, CPython emits NO forward jump -- it duplicates the
    # whole continuation into both arms and clears the stack between them, so the second

    # fixture below rather than here, because this fixture's invariant is that every
    # callee is `target`. `via_subscript` is that case: it asserts the site exists and
    # carries a sentinel, which is exactly what suppressing too eagerly would destroy.

# ── THE SECOND DEFECT: A SENTINEL, NOT A CONTAINER ───────────────────────────
# BINARY_SUBSCR consumes two slots and pushes one, but the generic fallback applied only the NET
# effect, so the CONTAINER survived in the callee slot: `TABLE["d"](n)` was attributed to `TABLE`.
# The control is one opcode away and was always right, which is what isolated it.
#
# What makes this worth a gate rather than a cosmetic label: UNKNOWN has to mean "attribution
# failed". A container name in the callee slot is neither a real callee nor an admission of
# defeat, so a consumer cannot tell "statically unnameable by construction" from "the walk
# drifted" -- and the registry-dispatch idiom is exactly where a call graph most needs to say
# which it is. The CALL_OPS path already had the answer (<call-result> / <super>); subscript now
# uses it too.
#
# PINNED, like the half above, and for a measured reason rather than a guessed one. It is tempting
# to call this interpreter-independent because BINARY_SUBSCR exists everywhere the harness supports
# — but on 3.12 the walk misattributes BOTH `TABLE["d"](n)` and the `TABLE.get("d")(n)` CONTROL,
# and the control has nothing to do with this fix. 3.11 changed LOAD_GLOBAL to push a NULL beside
# the global, so the whole slot arithmetic differs off-pin. tier 1 is simply not accurate there,
# which is what the harness means by "opcode shapes differ; numbers are not comparable" — the locks
# are 3.10. So this runs only where it means something, and says so otherwise.
