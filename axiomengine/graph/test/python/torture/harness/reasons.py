"""The unresolved-REASON distribution, as a pinned artifact.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Every other golden in this suite is an EDGE list, so a change that
alters no edge is invisible to all of them — and the diagnosis a blind spot carries
is exactly that kind of change. `no_rule` is defined in
call-edge-generation/call_chain.dl as a site that could not be resolved AND could not
be explained, and site_reason's own comment says the difference it makes: "a blind
spot you can name is a work item; one you cannot is a mystery."

Nothing was checking the mysteries. `no_rule` could grow by a hundred sites, or a
reason could stop firing entirely, and all thirteen checks would stay green. This is
the counterpart of test/java's previous-vs-present scorer (#158) for the one axis this
front end reports on and did not pin.

The artifact is a COUNT PER REASON, not a per-site list, because the per-site set
churns with every fixture added while the distribution is what a reader interprets.
A new reason appearing, an old one vanishing, or a count moving all show up as a diff.
