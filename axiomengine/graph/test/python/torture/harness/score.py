"""Per-FAMILY coverage against tier-4.

Identity: the call site (clientFile, line) -> the callee's (prov, file, defLine).
A line can hold several calls, so a hit means the engine has the true target
somewhere on that line; every fixture line is written to hold one interesting
call so this stays tight.

Verdicts: CONCRETE (exactly the observed target) · SUPERSET (contains it, wider)
· WRONG (answered, target absent) · MISSED (nothing emitted).
`# EXPECT: miss` cases are scored in their own bucket -- a known miss that starts
passing is reported, not silently absorbed.

# truth is built by walking lib/ on disk, so a library file is `tlib/shapes.py`. The
# ENGINE side used to report `shapes.py` -- the package prefix was dropped -- so this
# stripped `tlib/` off the truth to make the two meet. The parser now reports the prefix
# on both sides, and a ONE-SIDED strip does not fail loudly: it renames one side's files,
# so every library link scores MISSED while the engine's answer is correct. That read as
# a total engine collapse with a large WRONG count and no engine change behind it.
# One canonicalisation applied to both sides is what makes the score insensitive to

# ── SCORED PER LINK THAT ACTUALLY RAN ────────────────────────────────────────
# Two earlier keyings were both incoherent and it is worth recording why.
#   (file,line) on BOTH sides -- collapses `a() + b()` into one site. MEASURED: 16 of 51
#       lines here hold more than one callee, hiding 27% of the work from the score.
#   (file,line,calleeName) for TRUTH but (file,line) for the ENGINE -- compares one
#       site's true target against the union of every engine answer on the line, so a
#       three-call line reports three SUPERSETs and `get`'s answer is judged against
#       `tag`'s truth as WRONG. Pure artifact; it read 50.0% where nothing had changed.
# Per-SITE matching on both sides is not available: the engine names a site by what the
# SOURCE WRITES (`Point` for a construction, the attribute for a callable instance,
# nothing at all for a property read) while the trace names it by the runtime __name__.
# Those do not correspond without a mapping layer that would itself be a defect source.
# So ask the question that IS well posed on both sides: for each link that actually ran,
# did the engine emit it? Same quantity harness/scorecard.py reports in aggregate,
# broken down per construct family. Over-claims are counted separately.
