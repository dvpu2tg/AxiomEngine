"""FAMILY 35 — a SUBSCRIPTED member inside a PEP 604 union: `Payload[str] | None`.

This family was added when that one spelling was the only annotation shape whose head
type could not be read off `py_type_reference` at all. Its four neighbours arrived
structured and it did not:

    Payload | None            UNION_PEP604  2 children   isOptional=true
    Optional[Payload]         OPTIONAL      1 child      isOptional=true
    Optional[Payload[str]]    OPTIONAL      1 child (SUBSCRIPT, FK resolved)
    Payload[str]              SUBSCRIPT     1 child,     FK resolved
    Payload[str] | None       UNKNOWN       NO children, typeName EMPTY   <- was

so `annotation_single_name_kind` could not see it, `annotation_optional_kind` could not
see it, and no GENERIC_ARGUMENT child existed to take an element from. The only thing
that yielded `Payload` was `parameterBaseType` / `fieldBaseType` — the annotation
truncated at the first `[` — which held for the parameter and the field and NOT for the
return, whose `returnTypeName` is untruncated. That asymmetry was the finding, and the
return case was a declared miss.

anonymous-org/parser#148 CLOSED IT. The union now arrives as `UNION_PEP604` with one
`GENERIC_ARGUMENT` child per operand, the subscripted operand as a `SUBSCRIPT` child
carrying its own resolved FK, in all three positions. Every case below resolves from the
type-reference table alone, the entity-column clauses that used to carry two of them are
deleted, and the return case is no longer marked miss.

SO THE FAMILY STAYS AS THE GUARD ON THAT ROUTE, which is the only reason it is still
here: if the union ever stops being decomposed, or the head FK stops resolving, these
seven cases go ambiguous_unknown and nothing else in the suite notices.

EVERY VALUE COMES OUT OF `_from_bag`, WHICH IS UNANNOTATED, so the annotation is the
only thing that can type it. Handing `Payload()` in directly would let argument flow
supply the answer and the annotation would never be consulted — an earlier draft of
this file did exactly that and passed with the annotation rules removed.

`| None` is deliberate throughout — the shape only collapsed when a subscript was a
union OPERAND, so a union that is not optional would not exercise it. The
`plain`/`Optional[...]` twins are controls: same type, same position, a spelling that
always worked, so a failure here is attributable to the union operand and not to
generics.
