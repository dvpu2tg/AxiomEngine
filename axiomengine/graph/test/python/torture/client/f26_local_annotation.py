"""FAMILY 26 — a local variable's annotation types the value (#123, PEP 526).

The engine read annotations on parameters, fields and returns and ignored the one on a
local. Both halves are covered here: an annotation naming a BUILTIN, and one naming a
CLASS in the tree -- the second loses a real client edge, not just a boundary label.

BOTH VALUES COME THROUGH `passthrough`, the unannotated library function, and that is what
makes the family discriminate. Library bodies are staged empty by design, so the engine
cannot see what it returns: no flow reaches either local and the annotation is the only
statement about it. Assigning `set()` or `Derived()` directly would let literal inference
and value flow answer both sites, and the fixture would pass with the rule reverted.

An annotation is a DECLARED type, so `declared.label()` must widen over the override
rather than naming Base alone -- the confident-wrong shape this engine has produced four
times from exactly this omission.

    # leaf` leaves the reference FK resolved, so the FK clause from #123 answers it and the
    # case proves nothing -- the first version of this fixture did exactly that and passed
    # with the new clause removed. Under an alias the FK is empty, which is the same shape
    # the real corpora show.
