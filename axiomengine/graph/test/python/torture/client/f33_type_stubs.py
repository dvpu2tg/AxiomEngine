"""FAMILY 33 — a .pyi declaration is not a call target (issue #223).

A stub is not importable: CPython's `importlib.machinery.SOURCE_SUFFIXES` is
`['.py']`, and `import accelstub` raises ModuleNotFoundError. No function object
ever exists at a name a stub declares — the implementation is elsewhere, normally a
C extension. So an edge to a stub is outside every sound envelope: not wide, WRONG.

Two shapes, and the second is the one with a runtime answer to check against.

    `accelstub.pyi` has no `.py`, so importing it raises ModuleNotFoundError. The

    exactly the property under test. What pins it is expected/torture.edges: the
    site must be `boundary_lib -> external:accelstub.fast`, a NAMED boundary,
    rather than the `known_edge -> accelstub.fast` it was before the gate. A
    committed single target into a file that cannot be imported is the fabricated
    edge the design forbids.

    Named, not shrugged at: the callee is known exactly and the only reason it
    cannot be followed is that its implementation is not Python — the same
    argument resolution/builtin-types.dl makes for list.append.

    `external:tlib.stubonly.open_gauge` instead: a named boundary, which is exactly as
    much as a stub justifies.

    Worth knowing that this did not always reproduce. On an earlier revision the stub
    stayed a named boundary on its own, and the library-linking work since made it
    link — so this fixture is the thing that keeps the answer fixed either way.
