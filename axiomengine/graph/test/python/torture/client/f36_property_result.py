"""FAMILY 36 — CALLING SOMETHING ON WHAT A `@property` RETURNS (issue #286).

`attribute-lookup.dl` already argues that `obj.x` on a `@property` IS a method call and
`call_chain.dl` emits the PROPERTY_READ edge for it. What nothing did was give the
ATTRIBUTE EXPRESSION the getter's type, so the edge was emitted and its result was
untyped, and anything called on that result was `ambiguous_unknown` with reason
`no_rule`.

The three rules that type a call result -- `call_returns_type` (a) declared `-> X`,
(b) return-of-parameter, (c2) the return expression's own type -- are all keyed on
`expr_call_candidate(site, m)`, and a property read HAS NO CALL SITE. So none of them
could reach these, and the field clauses could not either, because a property is not a
field. Measured across three open-source projects, 995 / 90 / 227 `no_rule` sites had a
property-read receiver; on the first that was 60.2% of its entire `no_rule` residual.

The shape is the framework-accessor idiom, and `app.router.add_get(...)` is its most
common spelling in the wild:

    class Application:
        @property
        def router(self) -> UrlDispatcher: return self._router

WHY EACH CASE IS HERE. The getter can be typed two ways and the difference matters --
`annotated` reads the `-> X`, `inferred` has no annotation at all and is typed from the
expression it returns, which is the majority form in real code. `overridden` is the
widening check: a declared return type is a DECLARED type, not an exact one, so a
subclass override must stay in the set. `chained` is two property hops, which is what
proves the rule composes rather than working one level deep. `container` is the element
path, which lives in a different relation (`element_type_of`) and would otherwise be
untested. The two `lib_` cases cross the boundary in both directions, and the boundary is
where a separate relation (`expr_lib_type`) takes over.

`cached` is the `@functools.cached_property` spelling of `annotated`, pinned separately
because it reaches the same rule only through the parser's `methodKind` classification
(anonymous-org/parser#147) rather than through anything the engine controls. Its getter is
underscored for a reason recorded at the getter itself: tier 4 cannot observe a cached
getter's invocation at all.

`builtin_annotated`, `builtin_container` and `builtin_inferred` cover the builtin
dimension -- `expr_builtin_type` and `element_builtin_iterated_of`,
whose own file warns that it was left behind when `expr_type` and the element types were
generalised past `self.` -- so a property read reaching it is checked here rather than
assumed.

`plain_field` is the control: identical call shape through an ordinary annotated field,
which already worked. If it ever fails alongside the others, the fault is not here.

        #
        # UNDERSCORED DELIBERATELY, and the reason is a fact about the ground truth rather
        # than about naming. `property.__get__` is C, so a plain getter's frame has the
        # READING function as its Python parent and tier 4 records a client -> client edge
        # for it. `functools.cached_property.__get__` is PYTHON, so this body's parent
