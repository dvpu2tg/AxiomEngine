# axiomengine — Python engine regression suite  (client -> client ONLY)
#
# For every case in test/python/cases/<name>/src:
#   1. parse the source to IR           (external parser, $AXIOM_PARSER)
#   2. solve with the engine            (graph/pipeline/run-souffle.sh --language python)
#   3. COVERAGE GUARD: no call site may vanish silently
#   4. GOLDEN DIFF: normalized edges vs expected/<name>.edges
#   4b. TIER/REASON CENSUS: site counts, tier mix and unresolved reasons vs
#       expected/<name>.tiers -- the axis a deduplicated edge set cannot see
#   5. CPYTHON ORACLE (--oracle): score against the FROZEN ground truth
#
# SCOPE IS CLIENT->CLIENT BY DESIGN, AND NO STDLIB IR IS STAGED. Library linking is
# python-library-linking's problem and is measured separately, so a regression here is
# never ambiguous about which layer broke. The engine is handed an EMPTY library root,
# which means:
#   - nothing outside the repo is needed to run this suite (the stdlib IR is 462 MB);
#   - a call into the stdlib is reported by NAME (external:functools.wraps) or as
#     ambiguous_unknown, instead of as an opaque PY_METHOD_<hash> that no reader can
#     check — so the goldens got more reviewable, not less.
#
#   ./run-tests.sh                 every case + both whole-project fixtures + torture
#   ./run-tests.sh --oracle        ALSO validate against CPython-built ground truth
#   ./run-tests.sh 04 11           only cases matching those substrings
#   ./run-tests.sh --bless         regenerate ENGINE goldens (REVIEW the diff)
#   ./run-tests.sh --oracle-only   ground-truth checks alone; needs no engine
#   ./run-tests.sh --keep          keep per-case work dirs
#
# --bless REGENERATES ENGINE GOLDENS ONLY. It cannot touch the CPython ground
# truth: that lives outside this repo, at $AXIOM_PY_ORACLE/locks, and only
# `bin/freeze.py` there can author it. The split is deliberate — if re-blessing
# the ground truth lived beside the code under test, the quickest way past a red
# check would be to re-bless, and a bug present at that moment would become the
# permanent expectation.
#
# Environment:
#   AXIOM_PARSER      parser entrypoint        (default parser/dist/index.js — the parser in this repository)
#   AXIOM_SUITE_JOBS  cases run at once (default: the CPU count; 1 = one at a time, output uncaptured)
#   AXIOM_PY_ORACLE   harness checkout         (--oracle only; default ../../../callchain-oracle/python)
#   AXIOM_PY_PYTHON   pinned interpreter       (default python3.10; also used by the
#                     tier-1 attribution preflight, which is version-sensitive)
#
# NO STDLIB IR IS USED OR REQUIRED.

# ── THE WHOLE-PROJECT FIXTURES ───────────────────────────────────────────────
# test/python/projects holds two realistic projects, 29 files and ~1,040 lines, which
# caught six engine defects the single-construct cases could not. THE SUITE NEVER RAN
# THEM: the loop above iterates cases/*/ and requires a src/ subdirectory, which these do
# not have, so nothing checked them and the tier counts recorded beside them were
# transcribed by hand.
#
# They had drifted. Against the engine's own per-tier SITE counts: known_edge 123 -> 124,
# boundary_lib 76 -> 70, ambiguous_unknown 5 -> 10; the site total (227) and
# multi_inferred (23) still hold. The ambiguous_unknown row is the one that matters,
# because five unknowns were accounted for — four route decorators and functools.wraps —
# and there are five MORE nobody had counted: bare @abstractmethod in four shared modules.
# Confirmed NOT recent: identical at 4345f2f, before the six Python changes that landed
# after it.
#
# Pinned with the same artifact the cases use, for the same reason: an edge list cannot
# see a tier count move.
