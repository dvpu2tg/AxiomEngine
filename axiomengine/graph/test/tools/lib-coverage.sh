# ── The client->library half must not quietly stop being tested ──────────────
# Most of what these suites assert is client->client. The client->library hand-off
# is carried by a smaller set of fixtures, and it is the half that disappears
# silently: delete a golden and the case still runs, still passes, and simply
# stops making the claim. Nothing in the suites notices, because a suite can only
# check the assertions it still has.
#
# So this pins the SHAPE of that coverage, and it needs no parser and no solver:
#
#   1. every TypeScript case carrying a lib/, and every JavaScript case carrying a
#      dependency under src/node_modules/, is solved twice, and both goldens exist —
#      the delta between them IS the client->library mapping;
#   2. every Java case carrying a lib-src/ stub library still has its golden;
#   3. the counts never fall. A number here going DOWN is either a deletion that
#      wanted review, or coverage lost by accident.
