"""Previous vs present, on two engine runs over the SAME IR — did the change make anything worse?

A scale number that only moves in aggregate hides the two failures that matter most, because both
can happen while every headline figure improves:

  * a call site that had an answer and now has none;
  * a call site that had ONE answer and now has several, which is a precision loss even though the
    edge is still there.

Neither shows up in "unresolved fell by 700". This reads both runs site by site and reports them
separately, and it exits non-zero when a site was LOST or UNRESOLVED, because those are regressions
whatever else improved.

Both runs must be over the same client IR: the comparison is keyed on the expression hash, and two
IRs from different parser revisions do not share them.

LANGUAGE-INDEPENDENT, and it always was — it reads three columns of call-chain-edges.csv
(expression, callee, tier) and the tier vocabulary is the engine's, not any front end's. It
lived under test/java/tools for no reason other than where it was written, so the Python front
end had no previous-vs-present check while the tool that provides one sat one directory over.
Verified against a Python run: the CSV is the same 7-column shape.
