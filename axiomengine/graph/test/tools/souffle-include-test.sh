# the generated program includes its headers as `souffle/CompiledSouffle.h`.
#
# WHICH directory that is differs by installation, and the old test could not tell them apart: it
# asked whether a directory named `souffle` existed under `include`, which is true on every layout.
# So it returned include/souffle everywhere, and the engine still built on the machine it was
# written on — because Homebrew installs the headers twice and the nested copy makes that path
# work. On a source build or a distro package the same path cannot find the header at all, and the
# engine could not be compiled. See issue #216.
#
# Both layouts are synthesised here from the real header tree, so the assertion is about the
# resolver and not about whichever soufflé this machine happens to have.
