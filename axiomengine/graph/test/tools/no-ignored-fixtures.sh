# A fixture input that .gitignore matches is the worst kind of broken: `git add -A`
# reports success, the file never enters the index, the working tree keeps it so every
# local run passes, and the gate only fails for the next person to clone. It happened:
# a vendored fixture package's `dist/index.d.ts` — hand-written SOURCE that the fixture
# exists to stage — was swallowed by the repo-wide `dist/` rule that has been in
# .gitignore since the first commit and is correct everywhere else.
#
# The repo already carries a "never ignore engine source" safety net for `src/**`.
# There was none for `test/**`, which is this guard.
#
# Checks BOTH directions, because either alone passes while broken:
#   1. a file present on disk under test/ that git is ignoring — the case above, and the
#      one a local run can actually see;
#   2. a file a fixture's manifest points at that is not in the index at all — catches
#      the same fault after a fresh clone, where the ignored file simply is not there.
