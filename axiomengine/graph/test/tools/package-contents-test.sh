# What `npm pack` would actually put in the tarball, and whether an install of it could run.
#
# Every defect this guards against was invisible from a source checkout, which is why none of
# them was caught before: here the parser is built, the CLI is invoked by path, and the
# dependencies are present because a workspace install put them there. The published tarball
# has none of those advantages, and it failed on first use, for every language, on a machine
# where the advice it printed could not be followed.
#
# It reads the pack MANIFEST rather than installing anything, so it costs a second and needs
# no network. --ignore-scripts because `prepare` would otherwise run a full build and print
# over the JSON. The full acceptance test remains an install on a machine with no toolchain.
