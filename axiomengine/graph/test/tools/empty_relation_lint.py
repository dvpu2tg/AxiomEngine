"""Fail if any reader takes the header off a CSV with an unguarded `next()`.

A relation with NO ROWS is written as a ZERO-BYTE file — not a header, zero bytes — so
`h = next(reader)` raises StopIteration. In schema_drift.py that propagated out and the
TypeScript harness reported "refusing to measure against a drifted schema": the one failure
mode that gate exists to catch, and not what had happened. Ten such files appear on a project
small enough to have no enums, no decorators and no type parameters. See issue #244.

WHY AN AST LINT AND NOT A GREP. The safe forms are `next(r, None)` and a `try/except
StopIteration`, and both are ordinary code a text search cannot tell from the unsafe form
without reimplementing Python's grammar. This walks the tree instead: a one-argument `next()`
call, in a file that reads CSVs, not lexically inside a `try`. That is exactly the unsafe shape
and nothing else.

Three sites had it and one (lib_names.py) was already guarded, which is the pattern this whole
area keeps repeating: the same defect in several places, fixed in the one that happened to
crash. #238 was reported in 5 files and was live in 18.
