# The engine id (run-souffle.sh --print-engine-id) is what lets a machine WITHOUT souffle
# find the binary CI built for its rules, so two properties are load-bearing:
#   1. PATH-INDEPENDENT — the same tree at another path gives the same id (CI's checkout is
#      never at the user's path);
#   2. RULE-SENSITIVE — one character changed in one rule file changes it, in every language,
#      whether the file is a rule, a map, the manifest, or the pinned souffle version.
# Also: the emitted program contains no absolute path, and neither mode needs souffle.
