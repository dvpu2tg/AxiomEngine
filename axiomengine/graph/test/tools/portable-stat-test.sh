# The library-facts cache key, and the two parser-staleness guards, are built from file
# metadata. Nothing checked that the metadata read actually worked, and it did not: on GNU
# coreutils `stat -f FMT` is --file-system, so the key was computed from filesystem free-block
# counters and the guards compared a filesystem report against an epoch. Both failed silently,
# and a false cache hit does not present as staleness — it presents as an engine regression,
# because the run is answered from a library IR that is no longer on disk.
#
# So the key is CHECKED here rather than trusted. This is language-independent, cheap, and runs
# as a preflight: a wrong key makes every other number in the suite untrustworthy.
