"""The dispatch envelope of one case, in a form a human can check against the source.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `dispatch_candidates` is the set `call_edges` was narrowed FROM, and it is
the only table in the bundle that answers "what ELSE might run here". It was Java-only for
the whole life of the output bundle: the relation was computed in every language and
projected in one, so a consumer got a full answer from a Java bundle and silence from the
other two, with no error (#471). A relation that can be empty without anything failing is a
relation that can be silently reverted, so it needs a test that reads it.

The report is hash-free on purpose. Every id in the raw relation derives from baseMservPath,
so a golden written in hashes would only ever pass on the machine that blessed it; the
qualified names come from the IR and are stable across checkouts.
