"""STAGING GUARD — a relation the parser emits must actually reach the solver.

Adding a relation to the IR touches five places, and the two that fail SILENTLY are the
library ones:

  1. decls_base.dl        .decl java_X / .decl lib_X
  2. client-ir.map        java_X -> all-x          (staged for the client)
  3. lib.map              lib_X  -> all-x          (staged for libraries)
  4. staging.conf LIB_SIG the SUFFIX of lib_X, or LIB_BODY the full name
  5. rules that read it

run-souffle.sh scopes lib.map by LIB_SIG: a row whose suffix is in neither LIB_SIG nor
LIB_BODY is skipped with `continue`, so no .facts file is written, no .input line is
emitted, and the relation is EMPTY ON EVERY RUN. Nothing errors. A rule joining against it
derives nothing and Soufflé says nothing — the same failure as a declared-but-underived
relation, one layer down.

This guard turns that into a build failure. It checks:
  A. every lib.map row is actually staged (LIB_SIG suffix, or LIB_BODY full name)
  B. every client-ir.map relation has a lib.map counterpart, unless it is listed below as
     deliberately client-only
  C. every relation named in either map is declared in decls_base.dl

THE LIB NAMING CONVENTION IS NOT THE SAME IN EVERY FRONT END, and this tool used to
assume Java's. Java pairs `java_method` with `lib_method` — the language prefix is
dropped. Python pairs `py_method` with `lib_py_method` — it is kept, and
graph/python/templates/staging.conf says so in as many words ("THE PREFIX MUST BE py_:
the executor strips only 'lib_'"). With Java's convention hardcoded, `--lang python`
reported 19 counterpart failures that were all the tool's, so the guard had never run
on that front end at all — the exact hole issue #136 records for Java, one language
over. The convention is now INFERRED from the two maps and asserted to be uniform, so
a third front end needs no edit here and a MIXED convention inside one front end fails
loudly instead of being read as a missing relation.
