# A STAGED C# LIBRARY IS REACHABLE FROM CLIENT CODE (#1064).
#
# Before this, it was not. Every rule producing a type-name candidate bound ONE
# provenance across the module side and the declaration side, so a client file
# could only reach a client declaration, and a run with a library staged was
# byte-identical to a run with nothing staged. The assembly guard written to
# admit a library group key for a client module filters CANDIDATES, and no rule
# produced a cross-provenance candidate, so it had nothing to admit.
#
# TWO HALVES, AND THE SECOND IS THE ONE THAT PROTECTS EVERYONE ELSE:
#
#   1. with the library staged, each client call carries a real callee_method_id
#      whose provenance is `lib` -- not merely a name label;
#   2. STAGING LOSES NO SITE. Not "changes no site": staging REVEALS accessor
#      sites, because `x[i]` is only known to be an indexer call once the
#      indexer is declared somewhere. On one dev-set project 35 such sites
#      appeared. What may never happen is a site going away.
#
# The second half is asserted because the repair is a change to shared
# resolution rules, not to a library-only path: a rule that widened a join would
# show up here as a site set that moved, on a fixture with no library involved.
#
# And the UNSTAGED run is asserted too, in its own right: the README's rule is
# that an unstaged type is a NAMED BOUNDARY, not a blind spot. Every site in the
# unstaged run must carry an `external:` label, because a repair that made those
# sites resolvable-in-principle and then failed to resolve them would turn a
# named boundary into ambiguous_unknown, which is strictly less information than
# not staging at all. That regression happened once during this work.
#
# Exit 0 if every assertion holds, 1 otherwise, 0 with SKIP if the toolchain is
# absent -- matching library-staging-test.sh.

# into a blind spot, and during this work it did: a half-applied repair made
# those sites resolvable-in-principle and then failed to resolve them, taking
# `external:List.Add` down to ambiguous_unknown -- strictly less information than

# covered type: measured on one dev-set project, ten sites went from a named
# boundary to a blind spot and 32 property reads ceased to exist entirely.
