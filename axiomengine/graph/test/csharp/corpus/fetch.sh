# Nothing here is scored and nothing is installed into this repository. A C#
# subject needs no dependency install to be measured: the engine is run
# client-only and the oracle compiles against reference assemblies only, so the
# source tree alone is the whole subject. That is a real simplification over the
# TypeScript corpus, which has to npm-install every member before it can be read.
#
# NOT /tmp. The TypeScript corpus lost all nine projects' source mid-session to the
# system's /tmp reaper, with the directories left standing and .git gone, and it
# surfaced as four unrelated-looking harness failures. Override with CS_CORPUS.
