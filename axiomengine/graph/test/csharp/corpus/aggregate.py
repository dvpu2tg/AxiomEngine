Aggregate the per-project scores from a corpus run, and diff two runs.

  aggregate.py <work-dir>                       one run, two tables
  aggregate.py <before-dir> <after-dir>         the diff, with a verdict

THE TWO SETS ARE NEVER SUMMED. A combined number cannot answer the one question
that matters about a rule change: did it generalise, or did it fit the projects it
was written against. So dev and holdout get separate tables and the diff reports
them side by side.

THE VERDICT IS THE ACCEPTANCE BAR, APPLIED MECHANICALLY rather than read off a
table by eye:

  FAIL  a site was dropped, or an external target was wrongly resolved. Both are
        defects rather than imprecision: a dropped site is invisible downstream,
        and a wrongly resolved external target is an edge the compiler does not
        make.
  FAIL  the dispatch fan lost a target it had before. A narrower fan looks like a
        precision win in a summary and is an unsoundness.
  FAIL  dev improved and holdout got worse. That is the definition of fitting the
        dev set, and it is the check a human reviewer reliably forgets.
  WARN  dev improved and holdout's agreement RATE fell while its agreeing COUNT rose
        on a larger population. A change that makes a construct visible for the
        first time enlarges the denominator, so the rate can fall with every
        previously scored site keeping its verdict. Reported with the counts and an
        instruction to re-score both runs with the construct excluded from HELD,
        which is the only way to compare one population with itself.
  WARN  dev improved and holdout did not move. Not a failure -- a construct may
        genuinely not occur in the held-out set -- but it is not evidence of
        generalisation either, and it must not be reported as though it were.
  PASS  both sets moved the same way, and nothing regressed.

    Whether a FALLEN AGREEMENT RATE on this set is dilution by newly visible sites
    rather than a regression, and the counts that say so.

    THE RATE CANNOT ANSWER THIS ON ITS OWN. `in_source_sites` counts the in-source
    sites the engine SAW -- it is exactly declared_agree + declared_differs +
    declared_none -- so a change that makes a construct visible for the first time
    ENLARGES the denominator. Every site that was already scored can keep its
    verdict and the rate still falls, because the new ones agree at a lower rate
    than the old average. That is not the shape the dev-set-fitting check is looking
    for, and reporting it as "the rule fits the dev set" names the wrong cause on the
    run where it matters most.

    It is dilution only when ALL THREE hold:
      - the population GREW (a shrinking one means sites stopped being seen),
      - agreeing sites ROSE in absolute number, and
      - they rose by at least as much as disagreeing sites did.

    Anything else is a real regression and keeps the old verdict. In particular a
    population that grew while agreement FELL is the worst case, not the best one.

    THIS IS NOT A WAY PAST THE GATE. The result is a WARN with the counts printed and
    an instruction to re-score both runs with the new construct excluded from HELD,
    which is the only comparison that puts the two runs on one population. A WARN
    still has to be read.
