# Does `--library` actually do anything for C#?
#
# WHY THIS IS NOT A CASE UNDER cases/. The per-case suite runs the engine through
# devrun.sh, which stages every lib_* relation EMPTY by design: it exists to
# iterate a rule against one client IR. So the whole staging path -- name
# resolution across provenance, the heritage split reading the base's own
# category, member lookup answering a client question with a library
# declaration, and the stage<->solve loop's frontier -- is invisible to it. That
# is why a C# library could be staged and nothing it declared could ever be
# named, with the per-case suite green throughout.
#
# This runs the REAL executor, which is the only thing that stages.
#
# WHAT IT ASSERTS, and each is a separate failure that was real:
#   1. a client type can NAME a staged library type          (simple and qualified)
#   2. a client type EXTENDING a library type is in the hierarchy
#   3. a call on a library-typed receiver resolves to the library METHOD,
#      not to an `external:` label and not to ambiguous_unknown
#   4. the library frontier file is WRITTEN, so the body-staging loop can run.
#      A missing file read as a converged frontier is indistinguishable from a
#      project that genuinely calls nothing in its libraries.
#   5. a STAGED GENERIC type's `T`-typed member has the client's argument
#      substituted for it, so a chain through `IOpt<Settings>.Value` reaches the
#      client method instead of stopping at the library's accessor. Every part of
#      that shape except the argument belongs to the library, so a rule written
#      under one provenance passes every case under cases/ and does nothing here.
