#   ./run-tests.sh                     every case
#   ./run-tests.sh --only 03-target-typed-new
#   ./run-tests.sh --verbose 5         print the per-site failures for a red case
#   ./run-tests.sh <work-dir>          keep the per-case work under <work-dir>
#
# Named run-tests.sh because that is the entry point `bin/axiomengine test csharp`
# calls, the same as every other language in graph/test/.
#
# THERE IS NO --bless, AND THAT IS THE DESIGN. Every other suite here diffs against
# a golden file that a human blessed; this one scores against the Roslyn oracle. A
# blessed golden records what the engine did on the day it was blessed, so a rule
# that is wrong in the same way as the golden passes forever, and the quickest way
# past a red check is to re-bless. Scoring against the compiler removes both
# problems: there is nothing to re-bless, and a case needs no update when an
# unrelated relation changes shape.
#
# The CORPUS is separate and is not run here: it needs a network fetch and about
# half an hour. See corpus/run-corpus.sh and README.md.
#
# THE GOLDEN IS THE COMPILER, NOT A FILE SOMEONE BLESSED. Each case is scored
# against the Roslyn oracle exactly as a corpus project is, and the bar is the
# same: every in-source target agrees, every external target is labelled, no site
# is dropped, and no external target is wrongly resolved.
#
# That is deliberately different from a .expected file. A blessed golden records
# what the engine did on the day it was blessed, so a rule that is wrong in the
# same way as the golden passes forever; scoring against the compiler cannot do
# that. It also means a case needs no re-blessing when an unrelated rule changes
# the shape of an unrelated relation.
#
# EACH CASE CARRIES ITS OWN CONTROLS. A construct that must fan out sits in the
# same file as one that must not, so a rule that over-fans fails here instead of
# looking like a recall win. That convention is enforced by reading: the case
# files say which member is the control and why.
#
# Exit status: 0 if every case meets the bar, 1 otherwise. 77 if the toolchain is
# missing, so a machine without dotnet or souffle skips rather than fails.
