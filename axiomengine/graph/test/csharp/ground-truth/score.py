Score the C# engine against the Roslyn oracle.

WHAT IS BEING MEASURED, AND WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT.

The engine is run CLIENT-ONLY: it reads the project's own source and no dependency
IR. The oracle is compiled the same way, against reference assemblies only. So
every oracle site is labelled in_source or external, and the two are scored
differently because the engine is asked for different things:

  in_source   The engine must RESOLVE it, to the same declaration. Recall and
              precision are computed here and this is the number that matters.
  external    The engine must LABEL it, not resolve it. Scored as a labelling
              question: did the site reach the output as a named boundary.

THREE SEPARATE QUESTIONS, because collapsing them hides which one is failing:

  1. SITE COVERAGE. Did the engine see the call at all? An oracle site with no
     engine row is a site the parser or the engine dropped, and it is the worst
     failure because it is invisible downstream.

  2. DECLARED-TARGET AGREEMENT. The oracle reports the DECLARATION a call binds to,
     before dispatch. The engine's candidate is exactly that, so this compares like
     with like and isolates name resolution from dispatch.

  3. FAN SOUNDNESS AND PRECISION. The oracle's dispatch table gives, per concrete
     runtime type, the body that runs. The engine's resolved set must CONTAIN every
     one of those (soundness: a missing target is a wrong answer that looks right)
     and should contain few others (precision).

WHY SOUNDNESS IS REPORTED SEPARATELY FROM PRECISION: a fan that is too narrow
claims monomorphism the engine cannot support, and a reverse closure from the
missing target finds no caller. A fan that is too wide is merely imprecise. They
are different defects and a single F-score hides the one that matters.

COLUMN CONVENTION. The parser's startColumn is 0-BASED and Roslyn's is 1-based.
Verified on the probe project across seven sites, all exactly +1. The join adds one
to the engine's column, in one place, here.

THE JOIN KEY IS (FILE, LINE, COLUMN, CALLEE NAME), AND THE NAME IS NOT OPTIONAL.
A chained call puts SEVERAL sites at ONE position, because both Roslyn and the
parser anchor an invocation at the start of the whole invocation expression:

    : PascalizeRegex().Replace(input, ...)
      ^-- col 15 is BOTH PascalizeRegex() and Regex.Replace()

and `match.Groups[1].Value.ToUpperInvariant()` puts four at column 56. Joining on
position alone credited the inner call's resolution to the outer call's target and
reported 66 "wrongly resolved external" edges across the dev set -- every one of
them an artefact. The engine had resolved the inner call correctly and labelled the
outer one external, which is exactly right.

So each oracle row is matched to the engine site at its position whose callee name
agrees. Where a position holds ONE engine site the name is not required; where it
holds several and none agrees, that oracle row is a genuine miss for that call, and
is counted as one.

# The oracle site kinds the engine is HELD TO. A kind outside this set is reported
# but does not count against recall, and each exclusion is a stated ruling rather
# than a convenience:
#
#   foreach_protocol    GetEnumerator/MoveNext/Current. Real calls the runtime makes,
#                       written nowhere. Both oracles agree they exist; the engine
#                       does not emit them and neither does the Java engine (it
#                       excludes the same triple). Counting them would make every
#                       foreach a miss for a construct no consumer asks about.
#   implicit_conversion An implicit user-defined conversion has NO SYNTAX at the call
#                       site. The parser reserves CONVERSION_CALL for it and emits
#                       nothing, by ruling, because syntax cannot decide it.
#   property_accessor   Held to, but reported separately: `x.Name` is a call to
#                       get_Name and the engine should emit it. Counted in its own
#                       bucket so the headline number is not dominated by a single

        True where pairing `key` with these oracle rows would cross an indexer and a
        property accessor.

        `get_Item` IS THE COMPILER'S NAME FOR BOTH. An indexer's getter is
        `get_Item`, and so is the getter of a property that happens to be named
        `Item`; written together they anchor at one column:

            var x = items[i].Item;
            //      ^ ELEMENT_ACCESS  items[i]       -> the indexer on the receiver
            //      ^ MEMBER_ACCESS   items[i].Item  -> `Item` on the element type

        The oracle row is the indexer, external. The engine's only site at that
        position is the property read, correctly resolved to the element type's own
        `get_Item/0`. Name equality alone paired them and reported the engine as
        having resolved an external target to an in-source method -- the one bucket
        the harness treats as unarguable, and a gate that fails the run and the
        corpus verdict on a single occurrence. Eight of the fourteen such verdicts on
        the set measured were this pairing, invented here.

        The existing synthesised-name guard below does not cover it: that one only
        suppresses the SINGLE-SITE SHORTCUT, and the shortcut is never reached when
        the name matches on the first branch, which is exactly what a property really
        called `Item` does.

        THE TEST IS THE ENGINE'S OWN EDGE KIND, NOT THE EXPRESSION KIND. Carrying
        `kind` out of the IR looks equivalent and is not: a property read on an
        implicit `this` (`return Name;`) is a NAME_REFERENCE, not a MEMBER_ACCESS, so
        requiring MEMBER_ACCESS for a `property_accessor` row would refuse a correct
        pairing for every bare property read. accessor-edges.csv already records
        `indexer` / `property_read` / `property_write` in column 4, which is the
        distinction itself rather than a proxy for it.

        ONE-SIDED ON PURPOSE. The mirror rule -- a `property_accessor` row may not
        pair with indexer-only evidence -- would never run: this function is only
        ever called with the HELD rows, and `property_accessor` is reported
        separately rather than held, so no call can carry one. Writing it anyway
        would mean a branch no fixture can reach and a test that has to invent a
        shape the oracle does not produce to reach it.

        A key carrying BOTH kinds of accessor edge is also left alone: the key cannot
        tell those apart, and a rule for a shape nothing in the corpus produces is a
        rule nothing holds to.
