#!/bin/bash
# =============================================================================
# Trace one corpus project: mirror it, instrument the mirror, run ITS OWN test
# suite, and keep what ran.
#
# THE MIRROR IS THE POINT. Instrumenting in place would leave the corpus checkout
# rewritten, and every later engine run would analyse the tracer's own probes.
#
# THE SUITE IS THE DRIVER, not a workload written for this measurement. A trace
# from a workload someone wrote while looking at the engine's output measures the
# author, not the program. It also means the coverage is whatever the project's
# own tests cover, which is a property of the subject and is reported rather than
# worked around.
#
# WHAT A TRACE IS AND IS NOT. It is a LOWER BOUND on behaviour: everything in it
# happened. It is not an upper bound -- a path the suite does not exercise is
# absent, and absence is not evidence. The join enforces that distinction and the
# engine rules that read a trace only ever ADD, never subtract.
#
# Usage: trace-subject.sh <name> <work-dir>
#   <name> is a manifest entry. The TEST project is discovered from the
#   repository rather than configured, because a per-project test command is one
#   more thing that silently goes stale.

# ── the test project ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Discovered, not configured: a per-project test command is one more thing that goes
# stale silently. But discovery has to be more than "the first csproj that mentions
# xunit", which picked approval-test, snippet and source-generator test
# projects -- none of them the suite that exercises the
# library.
#
# Two filters, in this order:
#   1. IT MUST BUILD ON THE INSTALLED SDK. `-f net8.0` alone is not enough on a
#      multi-targeted project -- it still built the net9.0 leg -- so TargetFrameworks
#      is overridden to the one framework as well. Several of these repositories' test
#      projects target net10.0 only, and the static oracle is pinned to the 8.0 SDK
#      so a parser figure and an engine figure stay comparable. A project whose TFM
#      list has nothing the SDK supports is reported, not attempted -- otherwise the
#      run ends in a build error that looks like a tracer failure.
#   2. PREFER A NAME THAT SAYS Tests, and prefer the shortest such name, which is the
#      main suite rather than a satellite (`Foo.Tests` over
#      `Foo.SourceGenerators.Tests`).
# ── global.json ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Several of these repositories pin an SDK version in global.json, and the pin is
# newer than the one this harness uses. The pin is a developer convenience rather
# than a property of the program: the library and its tests both list net8.0 among
# their TargetFrameworks, so building them with the 8.0 SDK is a configuration the
# project itself supports.
#
# So the pin is RELAXED IN THE MIRROR and the deviation is RECORDED. It is a real
# deviation -- a newer SDK could compile the same source differently -- and it
# belongs in the manifest rather than in a comment nobody reads next to a number.
