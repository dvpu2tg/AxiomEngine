Put the run beside the engine, per method-to-method edge.

    join.py <trace-work-dir> <engine-raw-dir> <engine-ir-dir> [--json out.json]
            [--facts out.facts] [--verbose N]

The engine answers "which declarations CAN be called from here". The trace answers
"which ones WERE, in this workload". NEITHER IS GROUND TRUTH FOR THE OTHER, and the
buckets below are written so that no bucket silently claims it is:

  CONFIRMED     the engine named this edge and the run took it. The strongest
                evidence a static edge is real.
  NARROWABLE    the engine named several targets at a caller/name and the run only
                ever took one. The engine is SOUND here and imprecise. This is the
                bucket that answers "where could a static engine be tightened", and
                it is the one a runtime signal can act on.
  MISSED        the run took an edge the engine did not name. A demonstrable recall
                gap WITH A WITNESS, which is the most valuable output of this whole
                harness: unlike an oracle disagreement it cannot be argued away.
  NOT_EXECUTED  the engine named it and the workload never reached it. NO
                INFORMATION. Counted and then set aside -- never scored as an
                engine error, because a suite that does not exercise a path says
                nothing about whether the path exists.
  UNJOINABLE    a trace edge whose endpoint has no method in the IR. A conservation
                failure OF THE JOIN, reported separately so it can never be quietly
                absorbed into MISSED.

WHY NOT_EXECUTED IS NOT A PRECISION NUMBER. It is tempting to read "the engine
named 900 edges and the run took 300" as 33% precision. It is not: one member's
suite covers 554 of 604 methods, and the uncovered ones are uncovered, not
unreachable. A trace is a LOWER BOUND on behaviour and this file never treats it as
an upper one.

THE CALLER-ATTRIBUTION CAVEAT, STATED RATHER THAN BURIED. The tracer reads the
caller off a per-thread shadow stack that is pushed on entry and popped in a
`finally`. That is exact for ordinary control flow. It is NOT exact across an
`await` continuation resumed on a different thread, or inside an iterator's
MoveNext: the frame that resumes may see a different stack. Those edges are real
but their CALLER may be attributed to whatever the resuming thread was doing, so an
async-heavy subject will show MISSED edges that are artefacts of resumption rather
than engine gaps. The count of async methods in the id table is printed so the
reader can size that.

--facts writes runtime_observed_edge tuples the engine can read back. See
graph/csharp/engine/resolution/runtime-observed.dl for what it is allowed to do
with them, which is to ADD and never to subtract.
