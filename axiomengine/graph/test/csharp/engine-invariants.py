"""
Engine invariants, checked per case against the raw output and the IR.

WHY THIS IS NOT PART OF THE SCORE. The score compares the engine with the Roslyn
oracle, and there are true things about the output that the oracle has no opinion
about. A call through `dynamic` is the clearest: Roslyn cannot bind it either, so it
writes NO ground-truth row, and every verdict the score can reach -- coverage,
agreement, fan -- is blind to whether the engine answered `ambiguous_dynamic`,
`ambiguous_unknown` or `boundary_lib` there. All three score identically. Only one of
them is true.

WHY IT IS NOT A BLESSED GOLDEN EITHER. A `.expected` file records what the engine did
on the day it was blessed, so a rule that is wrong in the same way as the file passes
forever, and the quickest way past a red check is to re-bless. Nothing here is
generated from a run: each invariant is a written claim with its reasoning, and
changing it means arguing with the reasoning.

These hold for EVERY case, not just the one that motivated them.

    Every call site written on a receiver whose DECLARATION says `dynamic`.

    Taken from the declarations rather than from the call kind on purpose: the
    parser's DYNAMIC_CALL kind is reserved with zero rows, so a check keyed on it
    would pass vacuously on a file full of `dynamic`.

    The receiver is matched by its written NAME within the declaring method, which is
    what the parser records on the site (`receiverTypeName` holds the receiver's
    written text for a NAME receiver). That is exact for the shape this guards --
    a local, a parameter, a field or a property called through -- and deliberately
    does not try to follow an expression: a check that silently stops matching is
    worse than one that matches a stated subset.
