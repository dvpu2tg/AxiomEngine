# TypeScript engine evaluation — one project, end to end, reproducible.
#
#   parser IR  ->  library IR (discovered, not hand-listed)  ->  engine
#              ->  tsc oracle + CHA/RTA envelope  ->  per-site score
#
# ── WHY LIBRARY DISCOVERY IS PART OF THE HARNESS ─────────────────────────────
# The Java engine's own README names unstaged dependencies as the dominant cause
# of its residual recall gap: 79.8% of unresolved receivers pointed at libraries
# that were not linked in. The same is true here and more sharply, because in
# TypeScript even `string` and `Array` are library declarations — an unstaged
# `lib.es5.d.ts` costs thousands of sites, not a long tail.
#
# So which libraries to stage is NOT a judgement call to be made per run. It is
# derived from the client IR itself: every package the parser's own module
# resolution landed in gets extracted. A dependency that is missing from the
# report is then a fact about the project, not about who ran the script.
#
# ── WHAT IT WILL NOT DO ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# It does not install anything. A project whose node_modules is absent is scored
# with whatever it has, and the oracle's own diagnostic count is printed so a
# degraded run is visible rather than quietly weak.
#
# Usage: run-evaluation.sh <project-dir> <work-dir> [<parser-dist>]
# =============================================================================

#   <mirror>/test/typescript/.work-linking/eval/oracle.tsv
# and died on ENOENT, which reads as "the oracle failed" rather than "you passed a
# relative path". Surfaced while fixing #296. mkdir first so a not-yet-existing

# was told to use. That is how a fixture came to stage 27-column library IR against
# 28-column declarations while the client IR was current.

# ── 0. a TypeScript-only MIRROR of the project ───────────────────────────────
# The parser assigns ONE language per project and its detector tries Java first, so
# a repository that also contains .java or .py — this engine's own repository, or any
# polyglot tool — is analysed as that language and emits no TypeScript IR at all
# (observed: "no TypeScript call sites" on two of four projects). Mirroring with the
# other languages' sources filtered out makes detection deterministic.
#
# The ORACLE runs on the mirror too, not on the original. That is not a convenience:
# every position in the comparison is relative to the analysed root, and analysing
# one tree while adjudicating another silently mismatches every row.
# A PRESENT MIRROR MUST BE A COMPLETE ONE, and rsync's STATUS is not the test.
# Two separate things were wrong here. `mkdir -p` ran before rsync, so the
# `[ ! -d "$MIRROR" ]` fast path was satisfied by a directory rsync had not finished
# filling — a partial mirror was therefore permanent and silent, skipped by every later
# run. That is fixed by building at a temporary path and renaming on success.
#
# But the status is the wrong signal to gate on. rsync exits 23 and 24 for benign
# reasons (a single unreadable or vanished file), so treating non-zero as fatal breaks
# healthy projects; and it would not have caught the case that prompted this, where
# rsync exited **0** having copied nothing because the SOURCE tree had been reaped out
# from under it. `/tmp/ts-corpus` is not durable: measured, all nine corpus projects
# lost every source file mid-session with their directories and node_modules left
# standing.
#
# So the gate is a POSTCONDITION. A mirror containing no TypeScript source is not a
# mirror, whatever rsync said, and failing here names the empty source directory instead
# of surfacing four steps downstream as
#   line 200: .../ir/all-typescript-call-sites.csv: No such file or directory
# Part of #149.
# ── THE EXTENDS CHAIN HAS TO COME WITH IT (#240) ─────────────────────────────
# A workspace package's tsconfig almost always begins `"extends": "../../tsconfig.base.json"`,
# and that file is ABOVE the directory being mirrored. The parser then resolves the chain
# against a file that is not there and falls back to each option's DEFAULT — silently, on
# both sides. Measured on a package whose base sets `strict: true`:
#
#   parser over the real package dir : strictBindCallApply=true
#   parser over the mirror           : strictBindCallApply=false
#
# That option is load-bearing since #160: it decides which of lib.es5's two declarations
# of call/apply/bind the compiler answers with, so a defaulted `false` makes the engine
# commit to Function's where the compiler chose CallableFunction's. Note tsConfigPath is
# SET in both cases, so a guard keyed on "does this module have a governing tsconfig"
# does not catch it — the module has one, it just resolved against a missing base.
#
# So the mirror is rooted deep enough to hold the ancestors at the paths they are
# referenced by. tools/tsconfig_chain.mjs computes that with the compiler's own
# resolution (extends may be an array since TS 5.0, and may be a bare package specifier);
# REL is "." for a single-package project, which keeps the flat mirror unchanged.

# directory holds 2 entries while the repository root holds 972 including `vitest`, so the
# parser could not resolve `vitest` at all: 833 import rows came back UNRESOLVED with an
# empty packageName, discovery reads packageName and therefore found nothing, and the
# project was analysed with 1 staged package. Every `test(...)` and `expect(...)` call in
# it was unresolvable, and none of that was ever the engine.

# original tree. TypeScript resolves symlinks to their realpath, so a file importing
# its own package by name was adjudicated against the ORIGINAL while the engine's IR
# is the mirror:
#
#     src/selfref.ts  helper()
#         oracle  <original>/packages/wsp/src/lib.ts:1:1

#
# Same file, same line, same column, different root — so the two cannot join and the
# site scores WRONG while both sides named the same declaration. Pointing the link at
# the mirror keeps the resolution inside the tree actually being analysed, which is
# the same principle as mirroring the extends chain.
#
# This was invisible until #231: the project was ALSO staged as its own dependency
# from the original tree, so an original-rooted answer happened to be in the engine's

# root and its dist/ duplicates every declaration — and a duplicate is not harmless:
# the engine emits both, the site goes multi_inferred, and the copy the compiler did
# not name is scored as a wrong target. Measured on the Parser repository, staging
# `typescript` and `typescript/lib` as separate roots took WRONG from 115 to 384.
# ── ONE IR ROOT PER PROGRAM, NOT PER INVOCATION (#230) ──────────────────────
# The parser's contract is one output directory per PROGRAM (parser#74, closed as "give
# each program its own folder — merging is the consumer's job"), and since parser#78 it
# analyses every program under the root. So a single invocation over a package shipping
# several programs analyses them all and publishes ONE, silently — no module rows for the
# rest and no skipped-files entry either. Reproduced on two sibling packages under one
# root: "Found 2 total project(s)", "TypeScript files analysed: 2", one module row.
#
# TRIGGERED BY PROVEN LOSS, NOT DONE SPECULATIVELY. Enumerating sub-programs
# unconditionally is worse than the bug. One corpus dependency carries 143 nested
# package.json files under `dist/compiled/` — vendored bundled JS with no TypeScript in
# them at all — so a speculative fan-out means 143 parser invocations publishing nothing,
# and staging one package under two roots is not harmless: the engine emits both
# declarations, the site goes multi_inferred, and the copy the compiler did not name
# scores as a wrong target. Measured previously on `typescript` and `typescript/lib`:
# WRONG went from 115 to 384.
#
# So the root is staged first, and the parser's own numbers decide whether to look
# further: it reports how many files it analysed, the IR says how many it published, and
# a shortfall means the difference went nowhere. Only then are sub-programs enumerated.
# For every single-program package this is one invocation, exactly as before.
# Sourced rather than inlined so the fixture can test them directly (see
# fixtures/multi-program/run.sh). A predicate that only runs inside a 20-minute pipeline

# ── 6. chains, and the client/library boundary ───────────────────────────────
# score.py adjudicates one site against one declaration and is structurally blind to
# two things: whether the edges still join end to end into a chain, and whether the
# engine's client/library split agrees with the compiler's. Both need the CALLER of each
# site, which the oracle now emits.
