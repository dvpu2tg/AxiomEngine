# Does a package's tsconfig chain survive being mirrored? (#240)
#
# The harness analyses an rsync mirror of the project directory, and a workspace package's
# config almost always extends a base ABOVE that directory. The parser then resolves the
# chain against a file that is not there and falls back to each option's DEFAULT — with no
# error on either side. `strictBindCallApply` is the option that made this a resolution
# defect rather than a diagnostics one: it decides which of lib.es5's two declarations of
# call/apply/bind the compiler answers with.
#
# WHY THIS IS A FIXTURE AND NOT A CASE. Every case under cases/ carries its own
# src/tsconfig.json with nothing to extend, so no case has an ancestor config to lose.
# That is precisely why the defect survived a green 22-case suite.
#
# Usage: run.sh [<work-dir>] [<parser-dist>]
