# The type-flow gate: parser IR -> engine -> tsc oracle -> per-site score and chains.
#
# This fixture is CLIENT-ONLY except for the standard library, which it uses heavily on
# purpose: `Array.map`, `Promise.then` and `Map.get` are where a type argument has to be
# substituted into a library signature before the client's own receiver comes back out,
# and that is the same machinery a real dependency needs.
