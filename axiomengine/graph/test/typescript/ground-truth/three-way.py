"""
The three-way ledger: what the COMPILER saw, what the PARSER emitted, what the ENGINE
resolved — and a declaration identity that is a full path rather than a basename.

── WHY A THIRD COLUMN ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
`score.py` compares two things: the engine's answer and the compiler's. Everything the
parser failed to emit is folded into a single `adjudicable` count, so a site that never
reached the IR and a site the engine could not resolve are indistinguishable in the
number that matters. They need different people to fix them. This report keeps the three
columns apart and, for the parser column, prints the sites themselves rather than a
total, so "these call sites exist and you did not emit them" is a list someone can act on.

── WHY FULL PATHS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
A library IR records file paths RELATIVE to the directory it was extracted from; the
oracle reports absolute paths. Lacking a way to reconcile them, `score.py` identifies a
declaration by (basename, line, column) — and a basename is not unique. Measured across
this corpus: 21.5% of nest's identity keys and 25.5% of trpc's are shared by more than one
file. Almost all of those are `file:1:1` module initialisers that no oracle target names,
and at real declaration positions the join is sound on four of five projects — but axios
is not one of them. It ships two `index.d.ts` files whose declarations share positions,
and 17% of its adjudicated targets land on a key both of them own. Its accuracy number was
never trustworthy and nothing in the score said so.

run-evaluation.sh now writes `.source-root` beside every staged IR, so a relative path can
be made absolute again and the identity is exact. Where that file is absent this falls
back to the basename and SAYS SO, with the collision count, rather than reporting a number
whose soundness it cannot vouch for.
