"""
Chains and the client/library boundary — the two questions a per-site score cannot ask.

── WHY A SECOND CHECKER ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
`score.py` adjudicates one call site against one declaration. That is the right unit
for accuracy and it is blind to two things a consumer of this engine actually depends
on:

  1. CHAINS. "entryPoint reaches encode in four hops" is a claim about edges joined end
     to end. A run can score 1.000 per site and still lose every chain, because a chain
     needs the CALLER of each site as well as its target, and a site-level score never
     looks at the caller at all.

  2. THE BOUNDARY. The engine splits its edges into client_calls_client and
     client_calls_lib from the provenance of the IR root that declared the target.
     The oracle knows the same fact from a different direction — the declaration's path
     is inside the analysed project or it is not. Those two derivations agree or the
     staging is wrong, and a per-site score cannot tell: it compares targets, and both
     sides have the same target when a file has been staged twice.

── WHERE THE CALLER COMES FROM ──────────────────────────────────────────────
`tsc-oracle.mjs` emits the enclosing function of every call site, so the caller half of
each edge is the COMPILER's answer. Reading containment out of the engine's own IR
instead would make this a check of the engine against itself, which is not a check.

── WHAT IS AND IS NOT A FAILURE ─────────────────────────────────────────────
An engine edge the oracle does not have is a FAN, not an error: where dispatch is
genuinely ambiguous the engine emits a sound set on purpose, and the compiler names one
signature out of it. So engine-only edges are counted and not failed. An oracle edge the
engine lacks IS a failure, and a chain that dies is reported with the hop that killed it,
because "the chain is short" is not actionable and "hop 3 lost stageThree -> encode" is.
