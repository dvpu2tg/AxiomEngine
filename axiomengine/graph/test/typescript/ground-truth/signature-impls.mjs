/**
 * WHICH SIGNATURE DOES THIS BODY IMPLEMENT — asked of the compiler, answered by position.
 *
 * ── THE VERDICT THIS EXISTS TO CORRECT ──────────────────────────────────────
 * `const setState: Api<S>['setState'] = (...a) => { ... }` is, to the compiler, the
 * call signature declared inside a type literal in another file; to the engine it is
 * the arrow. When a call through that name is scored, the oracle names the SIGNATURE
 * and the engine names the ARROW, and `score.py` had no way to see that these are the
 * same callable:
 *
 *     oracle  vanilla.ts:2:3     TYPE_LITERAL_METHOD_SIGNATURE
 *     engine  devtools.ts:258:59 ARROW_FUNCTION  <arrow>
 *
 * so the site scored WRONG. Measured on a dev corpus member: 9 of its 9 WRONG rows are
 * this shape, on the project with the lowest exactness in the set. See issue #237.
 *
 * The credit already in `score.py` cannot reach it, and for two independent reasons:
 * the declarations are in DIFFERENT FILES, and the arrow is ANONYMOUS so no name is
 * shared. Both of its gates fail on the same rows.
 *
 * ── WHY THE CONTEXTUAL TYPE, AND NOT ASSIGNABILITY ──────────────────────────
 * The tempting question is "is the body's type assignable to the signature's type",
 * and it is the wrong one: `(...a: any[]) => void` is assignable to a great many
 * signatures, so that rule would credit unrelated functions and manufacture the
 * agreement it is supposed to be measuring — which is the failure `score.py`'s own
 * comment warns about for name matching.
 *
 * The right question is narrower: what type does the declaration ITSELF say the body
 * has. `checker.getContextualType(fn)` answers that from the annotation, the parameter
 * position, or the `satisfies` — and returns nothing for an unannotated function, so
 * an arrow that merely happens to be compatible is credited to nothing. Measured:
 *
 *     const f: Api<S>['setState'] = (...a) => {}   ctx -> vanilla.ts:2:3  vanilla.ts:3:3
 *     const g = (...a: any[]) => {}                ctx -> (none)
 *
 * Note the first resolves an INDEXED-ACCESS type across a file boundary, which is the
 * idiom the corpus actually uses to express an overloaded function type, and which no
 * join over the IR's own type-reference links can follow.
 *
 * An overload set yields every one of its signature declarations, which is correct:
 * the body implements all of them, and the oracle may name any.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER, DELIBERATELY ──────────────────────────────────
 * A class or object-literal member implementing an interface member is a different
 * route — the owner type is assignable to the interface, and the member is looked up
 * on it. `score.py` already credits that when the two are in the same file, and that
 * credit fires ZERO times on every dev corpus member as measured, so widening it is
 * not justified by anything observable yet. It wants its own issue and its own
 * before/after rather than being folded in here on the strength of a synthetic.
 *
 * Output TSV, one row per (body, signature) pair, ABSOLUTE paths so both sides of the
 * comparison resolve the same way `score.py` resolves everything else:
 *   implFile implLine implCol sigFile sigLine sigCol
 *
 * Usage: node signature-impls.mjs <project-dir> <out.tsv>
