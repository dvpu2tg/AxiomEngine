/**
 * Which `lib.*.d.ts` files are ACTUALLY in this project's program.
 *
 * ── WHY NOT JUST STAGE ALL OF THEM ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * `typescript/lib` ships ~110 declaration files and a program loads a handful of
 * them. Which handful is decided by `target` and `lib` in the tsconfig, and the
 * difference is not cosmetic: `lib.dom.d.ts` declares `Console`, `Array`, `Event` and
 * several thousand more names that a Node project does not have. Staging all of them
 * puts DOM declarations into a Node program's global scope, and then `console.log`
 * resolves to the DOM's `Console.log` instead of `@types/node`'s — measured on the
 * Parser repository, 384 wrong targets, of which the `console` family was the largest
 * single group.
 *
 * The compiler already computed the answer when it built the program. This just reads
 * it back, so the staged global scope is the one the project actually compiles
 * against rather than a superset chosen by the harness.
 *
 * Prints one absolute path per line.
 *
 * Usage: node lib-files.mjs <project-dir>

// then resolves to DOM's Console instead of @types/node's. The fallback even says so
// out loud; nothing acted on it.
//
// Discovery mirrors the oracle's. The lib sets are UNIONED across the discovered
// programs: strictly each program has its own global scope, but staging is a single
// shared scope, and a union of the libs the packages actually ask for is far closer to
// the truth than every lib TypeScript ships.
