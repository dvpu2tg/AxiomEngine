/**
 * THE DISPATCH ENVELOPE — the TypeScript analogue of the JVM front end's CHA/RTA sets.
 *
 * ── WHY A SECOND BOUND IS NEEDED AT ALL ─────────────────────────────────────
 * The JVM oracle reads two different truths from compiled artifacts: the DECLARED
 * target (`invokevirtual` names one method — a miss is undeniable) and the DISPATCH
 * ENVELOPE (class-hierarchy analysis over the same hierarchy — a result outside it is
 * a demonstrable false positive). Scoring an engine against only the first punishes
 * every sound over-approximation; scoring against only the second hides real misses.
 *
 * `getResolvedSignature` gives the first. This program gives the second, and it has
 * to be built rather than read, because TypeScript ships no compiled artifact and its
 * hierarchy is not the whole story.
 *
 * ── WHY CHA DOES NOT PORT AS-IS, AND WHAT REPLACES IT ───────────────────────
 * Java CHA walks `extends`/`implements`: a call on a `Handler`-typed receiver may
 * reach any class that DECLARES itself a Handler. In TypeScript that walk sees at
 * best two fifths of the truth — 60.4% of classes satisfy their interfaces with no
 * `implements` clause, and 21.5% of assignable pairs appear in no syntax anywhere.
 * The relation that actually governs dispatch is ASSIGNABILITY, and the compiler
 * computes it exactly:
 *
 *     checker.isTypeAssignableTo(candidateInstanceType, receiverType)
 *
 * So the envelope here is: every class in the program whose instance type is
 * assignable to the receiver's type, and which declares (or inherits) the member
 * being called. That is the honest superset — a value of the receiver's type can only
 * be an instance of such a class.
 *
 * ── TWO BOUNDS, AS IN THE JVM HARNESS ───────────────────────────────────────
 *   CHA  every assignable class that has the member.
 *   RTA  the subset whose class is actually INSTANTIATED in the program (`new C()`,
 *        or a class expression). This is Rapid Type Analysis's refinement, and it is
 *        what makes the bound tight enough to be worth reporting: a class nothing
 *        constructs cannot be the runtime receiver.
 *
 * ── COST, AND THE BOUND ON IT ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Assignability is not cheap and the naive form is |receiver types| x |classes|. Two
 * bounds keep it tractable: candidate classes are PROJECT classes only (a library
 * class the client never constructs cannot be a runtime receiver of a client-typed
 * value, and including the whole of lib.dom would dominate the run), and the
 * per-receiver-type answer is memoised by the checker's own type id, so a receiver
 * type appearing at 400 call sites is computed once.
 *
 * Output TSV, one row per call site:
 *   callFile callLine callCol callEndLine callEndCol callKind calleeName
 *   mustTarget   file:line:col of getResolvedSignature's declaration ("" if none)
 *   chaCount     size of the assignable-class envelope
 *   rtaCount     size of the instantiated subset
 *   chaTargets   ';'-joined file:line:col, capped
 *   rtaTargets   ';'-joined file:line:col, capped
 *
 * Usage: node tsc-envelope.mjs <project-dir> <out.tsv> [maxTargets]
