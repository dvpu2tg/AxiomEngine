# axiom-code-graph — TypeScript engine regression suite
#
# For every case in test/typescript/cases/<name>:
#   1. parse cases/<name>/src   to IR      (external parser, $AXIOM_PARSER)
#   2. parse cases/<name>/lib   to IR      — the case's own "library", parsed
#                                            SEPARATELY, exactly as a real dependency is
#   3. solve CLIENT-ONLY   (empty --library)      -> expected/<name>.edges
#   4. solve WITH LIBRARY  (--library the lib IR) -> expected/<name>.lib.edges
#   5. COVERAGE GUARD on both: no call site may vanish silently
#   6. with --oracle, score BOTH against the TypeScript compiler
#        expected/<name>.oracle       client -> client
#        expected/<name>.lib.oracle   client -> client AND client -> library
#
# ── WHY EVERY CASE IS SOLVED TWICE ──────────────────────────────────────────
# The delta between the two goldens IS the client->library mapping. A single run
# cannot separate "resolved correctly" from "resolved by accident": if the library
# link were spurious, removing the library IR would move the CLIENT numbers too.
# Pinning both makes that a reviewable diff on every change instead of a claim.
#
#   ./run-tests.sh                 run every case
#   ./run-tests.sh 04 06           run cases matching those substrings
#   ./run-tests.sh --bless         regenerate goldens from the current engine (review!)
#   ./run-tests.sh --oracle        ALSO validate against the TypeScript compiler
#   ./run-tests.sh --keep          keep the per-case work dirs for debugging
#
# expected/<case>.known-missing      accepted client->client gaps
# expected/<case>.lib.known-missing  accepted client->library gaps
#   One edge per line, `#` comments allowed. A NEW missing edge fails; a known one
#   that STARTS working also fails, so the debt list cannot silently rot.
#
# Environment:

#   AXIOM_SUITE_JOBS  cases run at once (default: the CPU count; 1 = one at a time, output uncaptured)

# ── PREFLIGHT: no reader dies on a big IR field ──────────────────────────────
# Python's csv module caps one field at 128 KiB, and an IR literalValue holding a base64 asset
# is several hundred KB. Every reader that opens an IR CSV then dies AFTER the extraction, the
# solve and the oracle have all succeeded. Costs milliseconds and is repo-wide, because the
# readers span all three languages. See issue #238.

  exit 1
fi
# ── PREFLIGHT: a relation with no rows is not a drifted schema ───────────────
# The parser writes a relation with no rows as a ZERO-BYTE file, so an unguarded next() on the
# header raises StopIteration -- and the TypeScript harness reported that as "refusing to measure
# against a drifted schema", the one fault that gate exists to catch. Lints every CSV reader in
# the tree for the same shape, because it was in three places and only one crashed. See #244.
if ! bash "$ROOT/graph/test/tools/empty-relation-test.sh"; then
  echo "aborting: a reader would die on a relation that simply has no rows"
  exit 1
fi
# ── The bundle stage must build the language-neutral output ─────────────────
# Every solve below ends by joining the raw relations to the IR and writing graph.sqlite
# (graph/bundle/SCHEMA.md); graph/*.csv is the same core tables and is written only under
# --debug. A broken bundler fails every case identically, after the
# solve's cost; this checks it in milliseconds on hand-written fixtures for all three languages.
if ! bash "$ROOT/graph/test/tools/bundle-test.sh"; then
  echo "aborting: the bundle stage does not produce the documented output"
  exit 1
fi

# ── PREFLIGHT: both sides of the comparison spell a declaration the same way ──
# `const step = (x) => ...` is `step` to the compiler and was `<arrow@1>` here, so every call to
# it read as one MISSING plus one extra -- and MISSING is this suite's failure verdict. The cause
# was reading a variable's ENCLOSING method (tsMethodLinkHash) as the function it binds
# (boundFunctionLinkHash), which also named the module initializer after an unrelated const.
# Synthesised IR, so it needs no parser and no solver. See #236.
if ! bash "$HERE/tools/arrow-naming-test.sh"; then
  echo "aborting: the engine and the compiler side name a declaration differently"
  exit 1
fi

# ── PREFLIGHT: an anonymous shape is not an owner, and both sides agree what is ─
# The same declaration at the same line had two names: `{ run(n: number): string }#run`
# here — the literal's own source text, truncated at 120 characters — against
# `members#run` on the compiler side, and in the OTHER direction `members#<arrow@39>`
# here against `Holder#<arrow@39>` there for an arrow that is an interface property's
# type. One MISSING plus one extra per call, on accuracy already got right, with three
# such lines parked in a known-missing file as gaps that never existed. Four of the ten
# checks are controls, including one that removes the relation the rule reads and
# requires the answer to DEGRADE — right for the wrong reason is not a passing rule.
# Synthesised IR, so it needs no parser and no solver and cannot skip. See #322.

fi

# ── PREFLIGHT: the dispatch envelope, and what the report claims about it ─────
# The envelope adds the resolved symbol's declaration set to the bound so that picking
# a different OVERLOAD scores as over-approximation rather than fabrication. It read
# that set off the symbol local to the declaration the compiler picked, which carries
# only same-file declarations — so every CROSS-FILE merge (`lib.dom` vs `@types/node`
# `setTimeout`, `String#replace` across two `lib.*.d.ts`) was dropped from the bound.
#
# The second half is what the report then said about the residue: one total labelled
# `demonstrable false positives`, of which 74 in 2,728 sat on a site the scorer itself
# called WRONG. Both halves land on a wrong ANSWER a reader would act on. See #242.
#
# The report check synthesises its own IR and needs no compiler, so it cannot skip; the
# envelope check needs a real TypeScript and says so when it cannot find one.
if ! python3 "$HERE/tools/envelope_report_test.py"; then
  echo "aborting: the dispatch-envelope report is not decomposing what it claims"
  exit 1
fi

# ── PREFLIGHT: what --production counts decides what every corpus number means ─
# `TEST_PATH` matched `.test.ts` and not `.test-d.ts`, the vitest convention for TYPE
# tests, so on the dev member whose type tests outnumber its source 11,055 of 11,818
# "production" sites were tests — and they score better than real code, so the leak
# RAISED the development rate. Fixed in #276, pinned here (#280). Five of the twelve
# pattern cases are controls: a filter's failure mode is symmetric, and over-filtering
# deletes real sites from the measurement just as silently. Synthesised, cannot skip.
if ! python3 "$HERE/tools/production-filter-test.py"; then
  echo "aborting: the production filter is not selecting the population it names"
  exit 1
fi

# ── PREFLIGHT: an unsupported compiler is a refusal, not a TypeError ──────────
# TypeScript 7 is the native port and its npm package exports exactly `version` and
# `versionMajorMinor` — no `sys`, no `createProgram`. The stack deliberately prefers
# the PROJECT's compiler, so a project pinned to the current major died on the first
# property access after a solve that can take a thousand seconds, and a reader seeing
# that stack trace goes looking for a bug in the oracle rather than for the pin. The
# last check is a LINT: a guard living in one of five entry points is not a guard.
# See #239.
if ! bash "$HERE/tools/compiler-load-test.sh"; then
  echo "aborting: an unmeasurable compiler is not being refused cleanly at every entry point"
  exit 1
fi

# ── PREFLIGHT: a proxy trap must not consume a call site's marker ────────────
# The runtime oracle's whole claim is "this declaration ran at this site". A trap runs
# when the LANGUAGE invokes it, inside whatever call happens to be open, so a trap
# instrumented as an ordinary function is recorded as the target of native operations
# all over the program: measured on immer, 19 of 366 executed production sites. The
# object-literal form was covered; a handler filled in after it is declared was not.
# The controls in that test are what keep the rule from swallowing ordinary code.
if ! bash "$HERE/tools/proxy-trap-test.sh"; then
  echo "aborting: the instrumenter is attributing proxy traps to call sites"
  exit 1
fi

# ── PREFLIGHT: one library that declares nothing must not end the evaluation ──
# `add_lib` returns 1 as an ordinary outcome — a deprecated `@types/<pkg>` stub is a
# package.json and a README — and at one call site it was the command after the final
# `&&`, so under `set -e` its status was the AND-list's and the whole run died
# mid-staging with no error line and no score. Every other call site was already
# guarded, which is what makes it invisible on review: the two forms differ by four
# characters and the unguarded one is the more natural thing to write. See #234.
if ! bash "$HERE/tools/staging-guard-test.sh"; then
  echo "aborting: a library that declares nothing would end the evaluation"
  exit 1
fi

# ── PREFLIGHT: the project is not one of its own dependencies ────────────────
# In a workspace `node_modules/<own-name>` links back to the package being analysed, so
# discovery staged it like any other dependency and every declaration in the project
# existed twice — one declaration, two answers, hedged instead of exact. Measured on a
# workspace built to that shape, changing nothing else: exactness 0.200 -> 0.800,
# decisiveness 0.200 -> 1.000. See #231.
if ! bash "$HERE/tools/self-staging-test.sh"; then
  echo "aborting: the project would be staged as its own dependency"
  exit 1
fi

# ── PREFLIGHT: a self-link points AT the mirror, not back out of it ───────────
# The mirror's node_modules is filled with links into the ORIGINAL roots, which is
# right for a dependency and wrong for a workspace self-link: it resolved back to the
# original copy of the project, so a file importing its own package by name was
# adjudicated against a tree the engine's IR does not contain — same file, same line,
# same column, different root, scored WRONG while both sides agreed. Measured on a
# workspace built to that shape: exactness 0.800 -> 1.000, one WRONG -> none. See #293.
if ! bash "$HERE/tools/mirror-selflink-test.sh"; then
  echo "aborting: a self-import would be adjudicated outside the analysed tree"
  exit 1
fi

# ── PREFLIGHT: a space in the checkout path must not empty the staging ────────
# NM_ROOTS was a space-delimited string iterated unquoted, so a path containing a space
# split into fragments and EVERY dependency lookup missed — no standard library, no
# @types, no dependencies — while the run still printed a score computed against an
# empty global scope. Same tree, one variable: /tmp/nospace staged 45 lib.*.d.ts and
# passed; "/tmp/with space" staged none and the oracle refused. LIBARGS had the
# identical shape. See #296.
if ! bash "$HERE/tools/path-space-test.sh"; then
  echo "aborting: a path containing a space would silently stage no libraries"
  exit 1
fi

# ── PREFLIGHT: a body that implements a signature is not a wrong answer ───────
# `const f: Api<S>['setState'] = (...a) => {}` is the type literal's call signature to
# the compiler and the arrow to the engine, so a call through it scored WRONG. The old
# credit could not reach it for two reasons at once — different files, and the arrow is
# anonymous. Measured on a dev corpus member: 9 of its 9 WRONG rows are that shape,
# WRONG 9 -> 0 and edge-correct 0.598 -> 0.641, every other bucket unchanged. Four of
# the six checks are controls, because the tempting rule — assignability rather than the
# contextual type — credits an UNANNOTATED arrow and manufactures the agreement it is
# supposed to measure. See #237.
# A `.source-root` the reader cannot resolve keys every staged declaration under a path
# nothing else names, and the empty join that follows is reported as a plausible rate
# over the client's own files rather than as a failure (#342).
# (The counters start here, before the first check that adds to them: they were initialised
# after it, so a failure here was counted and then reset to zero.)

  exit 1
fi

# ── another overload of the same callable is not a wrong answer ──────────────
# `_same_group` compared `declarationGroupKey`, which the parser populates for
# FUNCTION_DECLARATION and nothing else — so an overloaded class METHOD (3,272 keyless
# rows on one project) and every signature kind were invisible to the credit, including
# the construct signatures of an interface the standard library REOPENS in another file.
# Two corpus rows read as the engine naming a target the compiler disagrees with when it
# had named another overload of the same thing (#310). Two of the four checks are
# controls: a same-named method on an unrelated class must NOT be a sibling, or the
# grouping is a name match and manufactures agreement.

  # the hierarchy ADMITTED — the set those edges were narrowed from, and the only table
  # in the output bundle that answers "what ELSE might run here". Nothing downstream
  # consumes it, so a rule that stopped emitting it would move no other golden and no
  # test would notice; the relation was Java-only for the whole life of the bundle for
  # exactly that reason (#471). Both passes are scored: the library pass is where a
  # library-declared base gains a client override, which the client-only pass cannot see.
  # A case with envelope rows and NO golden fails, and a golden with no rows fails too.

# ── THE FIXTURES ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# `linking`: the golden cases parse a case's own `lib/` directory; they never install a
# PACKAGE, so nothing in them exercises module resolution, staging discovery, or a
# non-flat node_modules — the whole client->library boundary. That gate lived in
# fixtures/linking/run.sh and was not invoked by anything, so this suite could report
# 20/20 green while every linking mechanism was broken. A gate nobody runs is not a gate.
# Skipped, loudly, when the fixture cannot build (it needs a real `typescript` to
# symlink); never silently passed.
#
# THE FOUR GATES NOTHING RAN. The same reasoning was acted on for `linking` and these four
# were left, so the suite could report green while any of the four mechanisms was broken.
# All four pass today and take about six seconds each — they are unrun, not rotten (#332).
# Each isolates a question the per-case goldens cannot ask:
#   dispatch     an interface-typed receiver, where the compiler names the SIGNATURE
#                and the engine emits the reachable BODIES — two different right
#                answers, deliberately kept apart
#   typeflow     every way a receiver acquires a type other than being annotated,
#                with member names shared on purpose so a lucky name match cannot pass
#   overloads    one overload set reached through a barrel re-export and by direct
#                import, so a difference between the two consumers is the module graph
#                rather than the overload logic
#   specificity  generic-first overload sets in both directions, built because the
#                obvious fix for the largest corpus failure class is wrong
# Their second argument is a node_modules to stage a `typescript` from, discovered rather
# than defaulted to one developer's home directory (#331). Empty means the fixture falls
# back to its own discovery and says so.
#
# tsconfig-chain and multi-program are harness gates that take a parser and assert a
# property of the pipeline itself. Neither is expressible as a case: a case carries its own
# src/tsconfig.json with nothing to extend (#240), and none installs a package with several
# programs (#230). Exit 77 is a fixture declining for want of a parser — not a pass and not
# a failure.
#
# Not under --bless: they have no goldens to regenerate.
