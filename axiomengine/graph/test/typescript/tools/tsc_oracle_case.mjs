/**
 * GROUND TRUTH for one case, from the TypeScript compiler itself.
 *
 * `checker.getResolvedSignature(node)` is the compiler answering the exact question
 * the engine is asked: for THIS call, which declaration did I select. It is the same
 * role javac + javap play for the Java suite — an independent authority, never the
 * thing under test restating itself.
 *
 * Emits client->client pairs only, in the label form normalize_edges.py produces, so
 * the two are directly comparable:
 *     <owner>#<name>(<paramTypes>) -> <owner>#<name>(<paramTypes>)
 * The erasure rules are mirrored deliberately: type parameters to `T`, generic
 * arguments dropped, qualified names reduced to their last segment.
 *
 * With a LIBRARY directory, the program spans both trees and the callers are still
 * only the client's. That makes the client->lib edges ground truth too, which is the
 * half of the graph a client-only suite can never check.
 *
 * usage: node tsc_oracle_case.mjs <src-dir> [lib-dir]
