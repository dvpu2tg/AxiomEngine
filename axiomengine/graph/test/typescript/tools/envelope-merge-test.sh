# THE DISPATCH ENVELOPE MUST CONTAIN EVERY DECLARATION OF THE SYMBOL IT BOUNDS,
# AND NOTHING THAT IS NOT A BODY.
#
# `tsc-envelope.mjs` adds the resolved symbol's whole declaration set to the bound, so
# that picking a different OVERLOAD of the same function scores as over-approximation
# rather than as a fabrication. It read that set off `sig.declaration.symbol` — the
# symbol local to the declaration the compiler happened to pick — and that symbol
# carries only the declarations in ITS OWN FILE. Measured on a two-file synthetic:
#
#   dual("a")       declared twice in ONE file   both symbols give both declarations
#   ping("hi")      declared in TWO files        declaration-local gives ONE of two
#   theBox.open()   interface reopened           declaration-local gives ONE of two
#
# So same-file overloads were carried and CROSS-FILE MERGING was dropped — which is
# every `lib.*.d.ts` declaration merge there is. An engine edge to the `lib.dom`
# declaration of `setTimeout`, on a project whose `lib` list includes DOM, was scored
# as a demonstrable false positive while being a declaration of the very symbol the
# compiler resolved. See issue #242.
#
# ── AND WHY THE UNION IS FILTERED, WHICH IS THE OTHER HALF ───────────────────
# The merged symbol's declarations are not all callable. Unfiltered, taking the union
# added 16,686 declarations across 15,830 sites on one dev project — 9,989 of them
# `VariableDeclaration` and 5,654 `PropertySignature`. A value declaration is not
# something a call dispatches INTO, and admitting one widens the bound in the
# direction that flatters the engine. Only 56 of those additions were function-like.
#
# Four of the six checks below are CONTROLS for that: the bound must not grow a
# namespace, a value declaration, or an import statement, and the same-file overload
# behaviour that already worked must not change.
#
# SYNTHESISED FIXTURE, written here rather than borrowed from a work dir, so the test
# states the exact declaration relationships rather than implying them.
