"""AN EDGE OUTSIDE THE DISPATCH ENVELOPE IS NOT, BY ITSELF, A FALSE POSITIVE.

`score.py` printed `edges OUTSIDE the CHA envelope (demonstrable false positives)` over
one total. For a receiver whose type is a class that reading is exact — the envelope
enumerated every assignable class, so a target outside it cannot be the runtime
receiver. For a global there is no receiver to enumerate over, and for a member on a
library interface the bound is only the resolved symbol's declarations, so `outside`
means "a declaration this symbol does not have" — weaker than "fabricated".

Measured on two dev projects before this changed: 2,728 edges carried that label and
**74** of them sat on a site the scorer itself called WRONG. The other 2,654 sat on
sites scoring EXACT or SOUND_SUPERSET — the engine's set already contained the
compiler's answer, and the outside edge was a SECOND declaration of a right answer. A
reader taking the line at face value would have counted a 37x overstatement. On the
smaller project all six such edges were on SOUND_SUPERSET sites and none was a
candidate fabrication.

SCORING §4 calls the fabrication-vs-over-approximation split "the most informative
number in the report". This checks that the report actually produces it. See #242.

SYNTHESISED INPUTS — no parser, no solver, no compiler, no work directory, so this
cannot skip and cannot decay when a fixture moves.
