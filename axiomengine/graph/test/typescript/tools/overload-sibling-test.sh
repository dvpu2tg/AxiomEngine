# ANOTHER OVERLOAD OF THE SAME CALLABLE IS NOT A WRONG ANSWER.
#
# `score.py` already has the rule, and its own comment states it: "TypeScript overloads
# are compile-time only: N signatures, ONE implementation, so a call that reaches any of
# them reaches the same code." `_same_group` implemented that by comparing
# `declarationGroupKey` — which the parser populates for FUNCTION_DECLARATION and for
# NOTHING ELSE. Measured on one project's own code and the standard library it stages:
#
#     FUNCTION_DECLARATION   243 populated / 0 empty      149 populated / 0 empty
#     METHOD_DECLARATION       0 populated / 3272 empty
#     METHOD_SIGNATURE         0 populated /  209 empty   3922 empty
#     CONSTRUCT_SIGNATURE                                  143 empty
#
# So an overloaded class METHOD and every signature kind were invisible to the credit,
# and two corpus rows read as the engine naming a target the compiler disagrees with when
# it had named another overload of the same thing: `addSelect` (three overloads of one
# method in one class) and `new Set` (two construct signatures of SetConstructor, which
# the standard library declares in one file and REOPENS in another). WRONG 11 -> 9, and
# the development set to zero. See issue #310.
#
# ── WHY THE MERGED SYMBOL AND NOT A NAME OR AN OWNER ────────────────────────
# Joining on (owner, name) is the shortcut this scorer is careful never to take: any
# unrelated `addSelect` or `SetConstructor` would satisfy it, which manufactures the
# agreement the verdict exists to measure. `getSymbolAtLocation` returns the MERGED
# symbol, whose declarations are exactly the set the language treats as one entity.
# Checks 3 and 4 are that distinction and are the reason this is safe.
#
# A `new` or bare call signature has NO NAME NODE, so it gets no symbol that way at all;
# for those the merged entity is the INTERFACE, whose symbol spans every file it is
# reopened in. Check 2 is that path, and it is the one #310 is actually about.
#
# SYNTHESISED PROJECT, asserted against the emitter's own output — no engine, no solver,
# no work directory. It does need a TypeScript, because the claim under test is a claim
# about what the compiler answers; a stub would only restate the belief. Says SKIP loudly
# if none is found.
