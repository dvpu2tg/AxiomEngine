# A BODY THAT IMPLEMENTS A SIGNATURE IS NOT A WRONG ANSWER.
#
#     const setState: Api<S>['setState'] = (...a) => { ... }
#
# is, to the compiler, the call signature declared inside a type literal in ANOTHER
# file; to the engine it is the arrow. A call through that name scored WRONG because
# `score.py` could not see that these are the same callable:
#
#     oracle  vanilla.ts:2:3      TYPE_LITERAL_METHOD_SIGNATURE
#     engine  devtools.ts:258:59  ARROW_FUNCTION  <arrow>
#
# The credit that already existed could not reach it for TWO independent reasons — the
# declarations are in different files, and the arrow is anonymous so no name is shared.
# Both of its gates fail on the same rows. Measured on a dev corpus member: 9 of its 9
# WRONG rows are this shape, `WRONG` 9 -> 0, `implementation of tsc's signature` 0 -> 9,
# `edge-correct` 0.598 -> 0.641, and every other bucket unchanged. See issue #237.
#
# ── WHY THE CONTEXTUAL TYPE AND NOT ASSIGNABILITY ───────────────────────────
# "Is the body's type assignable to the signature's" is the wrong question:
# `(...a: any[]) => void` is assignable to a great many signatures, so that rule would
# credit unrelated functions and manufacture the agreement it exists to measure. The
# question asked instead is what type the declaration ITSELF gives the body —
# `getContextualType` — which returns nothing for an unannotated function. Checks 3 and
# 4 below are that distinction, and they are the reason this is safe.
#
# SYNTHESISED PROJECT, and the assertions are made against the emitter's own output, so
# this needs no engine, no solver and no work directory. It does need a TypeScript,
# because the claim under test is a claim about what the compiler answers — a stub would
# only restate the belief. It says SKIP loudly if none is found.
