"""
Score the engine's method->method graph against EXECUTED edges.

Runtime edges (instrument.mjs) are (caller function, callee function) at function
granularity, keyed "file:line:col" — the same token a js_method row starts at. The
engine side is method_call_edge rolled up from call-chain-edges.csv, including the
callback_registered and event_dispatch rows, since a callback that ran from a forEach
inside f is recorded as f -> callback at runtime too.

  EXECUTED_FOUND    an executed edge the engine has                       (recall numerator)
  EXECUTED_MISSING  an executed edge the engine lacks                     (the defects)
  STATIC_ONLY       an engine edge that did not execute — not wrong per se: a may-edge
                    on a path the entry script did not take, or an over-approximation.
                    Listed so width is visible.

Edges INTO a getter/setter are reported apart: a property read is not a call site in
the parser's universe (GETTER_INVOCATION is a reserved kind with zero rows), so the
engine cannot have them and they are a known, counted gap rather than a defect.
