# Trace one JavaScript project: mirror it, instrument the mirror, run ITS OWN
# test suite, and keep what ran.
#
# THE MIRROR IS THE POINT. Instrumenting in place would leave the checkout
# rewritten, and every later engine run would analyse the tracer's own calls. The
# mirror carries the source and symlinks node_modules, so the install is shared
# and the disk cost is the source tree only.
#
# THE SUITE IS THE DRIVER, not a workload written for this measurement. A trace
# from a workload someone wrote while looking at the engine's output would be
# measuring the author, not the program.
#
# HOW THE TRACER REACHES THE TEST PROCESS
# The rewritten code names `__ax` as a free identifier, so the runtime has to be
# loaded in the same process as the code under test, and a JavaScript project
# picks its own runner. Two mechanisms, applied together:
#   NODE_OPTIONS=--require   reaches mocha, tap, jest workers and `node --test`,
#                            which are all ordinary child processes.
#   a merged vitest config   vitest takes setupFiles from a config file and not
#                            from the command line, and its worker is where the
#                            test actually runs. The project's own config is
#                            MERGED rather than replaced: replacing it drops the
#                            include globs, the environment and the aliases the
#                            suite needs, and the run would then be measuring a
#                            different program.
#

# `dist` out of the copy costs two koa tests, which load `dist/koa.mjs` and fail with

# and the integrity check cannot tell the two apart. The instrumenter skips `dist` by
