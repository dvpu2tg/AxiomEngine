# One subject, end to end: what the engine says, beside what the program did.
#
#   trace-subject.sh   mirror + instrument + run the project's own suite
#   aggregate.py       per-worker traces -> one answer per call site
#   bin/axiomengine      the ORIGINAL tree (never the mirror) -> graph.sqlite
#   join.py            the two, per site, bucketed
#
# The graph is built from the original checkout on purpose: the mirror carries
# the tracer's own calls, and an engine run over it would be scoring a program
# that does not exist.
#
# Usage: run-subject.sh <project-dir> <work-dir> [<test-command>]
