# Portable file metadata. Source this; it defines file_mtime, file_ident and sha1_stdin.
#
# stat(1) is not portable, and the usual `BSD form || GNU form` fallback is WORSE than either
# form alone, because it reads the wrong thing while looking like it worked.
#
# BSD/macOS spells the format `-f FMT`. GNU coreutils spells it `-c FMT` and uses `-f` for
# --file-system, which takes NO format argument. So on GNU, `stat -f '%N %z %m' FILE` parses the
# format as a FILENAME (which fails, to stderr) and prints a FILESYSTEM report for FILE — block
# and inode counters — on STDOUT. Branching on the exit status cannot repair that:
#
#   * inside `find -exec`, find exits 0 whether or not the command it exec'd failed, so the `||`
#     fallback is never reached at all and the free-block counters are what gets used;
#   * in `X=$(stat -f %m F 2>/dev/null || stat -c %Y F)` the fallback DOES run, but the GNU output
#     is already in the capture, so X is a filesystem report with a number stuck on the end, and
#     every numeric test on it exits 2 — which makes a guard pass for every input, silently.
#
# Decide ONCE instead, by asking stat which spelling it understands, and never look at the exit
# status of a stat that may already have written to the stream being captured.
#
# See graph/pipeline/run-souffle.sh (lib_cache_key) and graph/test/java/tools/build-{jdk,lib}-ir.sh.
# graph/test/tools/portable-stat-test.sh asserts the behaviour these callers depend on.
