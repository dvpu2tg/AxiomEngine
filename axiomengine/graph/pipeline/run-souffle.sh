# Souffle executor — TEMPLATE-DRIVEN: the relation->CSV import map is parsed from
# client-ir.map / lib.map (single source of truth). Lib is auto-scoped
# to only the signature relations the rules reference (never loads GB-scale bodies).
# Usage: run-souffle.sh --client-ir DIR --library DIR --intermediate DIR --output DIR [--language L] [--debug]
#        run-souffle.sh --language L --print-engine-id      the canonical id of L's compiled engine
#        run-souffle.sh --language L --emit-program FILE    the Soufflé program CI compiles for L
#
# NO SOUFFLÉ NEEDED TO RUN. The rules compile to one self-contained executable that is
# project-independent; CI builds it for every platform and publishes it on npm as
# @axiomengine/engine-<os>-<cpu>, which this package lists as an optional
# dependency so `npm install` fetches exactly the one for the machine. The binary is
# resolved in this order:
#   1. node_modules/@axiomengine/engine-<platform>/<lang>/ — used only if its ENGINE_ID equals
#      the id of the rules in this checkout (edited rules never silently run a stale binary);
#   2. a locally compiled engine, when `souffle` is on PATH (cached under .souffle-cache).
# See graph/pipeline/engine.conf.
#
# OUTPUT LAYOUT — the same in every language (graph/bundle/SCHEMA.md):
#   $OUT/graph.sqlite   the contract: core tables + ext_* tables + the schema catalog
#   $OUT/csv/*.csv      the same core tables as headered text — ONLY with --debug
#                       (or when node has no node:sqlite, so a run always emits something)
#   $OUT/raw/           the per-language Soufflé relations, verbatim — engine-internal;
#                       kept ONLY with --debug (the regression suites score it)
# Soufflé solves into raw/; the bundle stage (graph/bundle/cli.ts) then joins the raw
# relations to the parser IR and writes the database. Without --debug the raw relations are
# deleted once the database is written, so a consumer sees one file: graph.sqlite.

# The stage<->solve loop far below is Java's JDK-expansion machinery (Python and C#
# use it too). TypeScript and JavaScript declare no frontier at all — no rule of
# theirs writes the frontier CSV — so every variable that loop reads is unset, and an
# unset column is NOT a harmless no-op: `cut -f""` is rejected outright by BSD cut
# ("cut: [-bcf] list: illegal list value"), and the count it feeds then printed
# `reachable_method = 0, forward_call = 0` on a run that had just resolved every edge
# it was asked for. A log line that reads zero on a successful run is worse than no
# line — it is the line a consumer greps for to decide the engine failed.
#
# So the loop is gated on the CONFIG DECLARING a frontier, not on the variables
# happening to hold something: a language that adds expansion later opts in by setting
# these two, and one that never will prints nothing to explain away. Issue #475.

# Written so that the SAME text comes out of every checkout and of CI: includes are relative
# to graph/ (souffle resolves them through -I "$SRC"), and the .input list is derived from the
# maps rather than from a listing of the staged facts dir, so it needs no client IR, and a
# machine that cannot stage (CI) still produces the text the binary was built from. The run
# path asserts below that staging created a facts file for every .input it declares.
# The input relations are: every client relation, the lib signature relations, the lib body
# relations (filled per iteration), and the four knob facts.
#
# NO PIPES, AND EVERY WRITE CHECKED (#1593). The text used to be produced by `printf` loops
# feeding `sort` through pipes, and produced TWICE: once into the program souffle compiles,
# once more inside engine_id() just to hash it. bash 3.2 (macOS /bin/bash) does not restart a
# pipe write interrupted by a signal, and nothing checked the status of a write inside a
# pipeline, so under load a line was sometimes lost with exit 0 ("printf: write error:
# Interrupted system call"). Lost from the hashed copy, it gave a different id and a warm
# rebuild became a full C++ compile (measured: 2183 s instead of 11 s, 3 in ~460 builds).
# Lost from the compiled copy, it would have cached a program missing an .input under the
# correct id. So now:
#   1. the text is assembled in memory, in this shell (string appends, globs and `read` from
#      the map files; no subprocess, no pipe), and sorted here too;
#   2. it is written to a temp file with ONE checked write, read back and compared byte for
#      byte, and checked against an independent derivation from the maps (verify_program);
#      only then renamed onto the destination, so no reader ever sees a partial program;
#   3. the engine id (engine_id_of) hashes THAT FILE, the one souffle compiles, never a
#      second rendering of it.
# A failed attempt is retried (program_file); three failures abort the run loudly rather
# than continue with a partial program.

# skipped java_xml_element, its program differed from one that has XML and it paid a
# full ~70s C++ recompile. That is per-INPUT-SHAPE, not per-project: the 26-case Java
# suite was falling into many shapes and recompiling for each (132 binaries had
# accumulated in the cache), which is why a suite of tiny projects took ~20 minutes
# to run and ~2 minutes to actually solve.
