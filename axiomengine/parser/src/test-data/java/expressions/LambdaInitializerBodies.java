/**
 * Acceptance fixture for statements inside a lambda that initializes a local or
 * a field.
 *
 * Two shapes produced no rows at all, so those call sites were neither edges nor
 * declared unknowns.
 *
 * (a) A BRACE-LESS control-flow body. Statements inside such a lambda are
 * deliberately skipped by the method walk and handed to the local-variable
 * walk instead, but that walk dispatches on a node's CHILDREN. A brace-less
 * body is the statement itself rather than a block, so it was never dispatched
 * and its calls vanished - while the identical code inside braces was extracted
 * normally. It affected if, while and for alike.
 *
 * (b) A THROW in a field-initializer lambda. Neither side handled it: the method
 * walk skips lambda bodies here, and the local-variable walk had no branch for
 * a throw. A throw inside a lambda that initializes a LOCAL was already covered
 * by the enclosing method's own throw pass, which is why the fix is scoped to
 * field initializers - extracting both would report one written throw twice.
 *
 * The braced forms and the argument-lambda form are the controls: they were
 * always correct, and they pin that the fix adds rows without duplicating any.
