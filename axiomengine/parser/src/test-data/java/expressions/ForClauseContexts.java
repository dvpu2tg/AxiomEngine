/**
 * Acceptance fixture for the three clauses of a basic for statement.
 *
 * The update pass matched children of the for_statement by NODE TYPE, so a
 * condition that happened to be a method_invocation, a unary or an assignment
 * matched the update set too and was emitted a second time with FOR_UPDATE. An
 * expression init clause matched as well, so `for (init(); cond(); step())`
 * produced three FOR_UPDATE rows for one update clause, and RootContext.FOR_INIT
 * was declared and emitted by nothing.
 *
 * Two consequences in opposite directions: a duplicated site inflates any
 * per-site denominator, and a call written in the init clause, which runs once,
 * was reported in the clause that runs every iteration - which is the whole
 * reason the three contexts are separate.
 *
 * The grammar labels these clauses `init`, `condition` and `update`, so the
 * fixture below covers each shape that previously collided with the type match.
