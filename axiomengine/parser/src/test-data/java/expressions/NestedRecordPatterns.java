/**
 * Acceptance fixture for the components of a NESTED record pattern (JEP 440).
 *
 * A deconstruction's top-level components each got a local variable row with
 * scopeKind RECORD_PATTERN carrying their written type. A component that is
 * itself a record pattern did not: its own components produced no row, at any
 * depth.
 *
 * The nested pattern is a direct child of the record_pattern_body, not wrapped
 * in a record_pattern_component, so a loop that matched only components skipped
 * it. A recursive branch existed already, but on the children of record_pattern
 * rather than of its body, where a nested pattern never appears.
 *
 * The consequence was quiet rather than unsound: with no entity for the binding,
 * a call on it is honestly a declared unknown and can never be anything else.
 * Matching a shape more than one level deep is the point of the feature, and
 * `Line(Point(var x1, var y1), Point p2)` is the JEP's own example.
 *
 * The single-level cases are the controls: they were always recorded, and they
 * pin that the recursion adds rows without duplicating the ones already there.
