/**
 * Acceptance fixture for the invariant that a comment does not change extraction.
 *
 * tree-sitter models a comment as a NAMED child, so any read that indexes into
 * namedChildren shifts when a comment appears. That is not a corner case: a
 * comment in an ordinary position moved the operand out of the slot being read
 * and the expression was dropped entirely, giving a call site with no row, which
 * nothing downstream can distinguish from code that makes no call.
 *
 * Measured before the fix, on the constructs below: 6 of 22 expression rows
 * disappeared and one changed kind, taking an instanceof pattern binding with it.
 *
 * This file is the twin of CommentsAreInvisibleControl.java. The two are
 * identical apart from the comments, and the test asserts that they extract to
 * the same multiset of expression rows. Asserting the equivalence rather than a
 * fixed list is what makes the fixture cover constructs added later: any new
 * positional read that a comment can shift will break the pair.
 *
 * Comments are placed in the leading position wherever one is legal, because a
 * leading comment shifts index 0, which is the index nearly every read uses.
