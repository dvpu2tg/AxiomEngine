/**
 * Acceptance fixture for `assert` (JLS 14.10).
 *
 * Both halves of an assert are ordinary expressions reaching the same code the
 * rest of the graph reaches, and they were extracted into nothing: not the
 * condition, not the detail message, and not the calls inside either. An absent
 * row is worse than a weak one, because nothing downstream can distinguish
 * "no call here" from "a call that was never recorded".
 *
 * The vocabulary already existed for this: RootContext.ASSERT_CONDITION and
 * ASSERT_MESSAGE, and ExpressionOwnerKind.ASSERT_STATEMENT, each documented with
 * a worked example naming this construct.
 *
 * `assert_statement` carries NO grammar fields, so the two halves have to be found in the child
 * list rather than asked for by name -- and `line_comment` / `block_comment` are NAMED nodes, so
 * a read that takes the first two named children takes a comment as an operand. The commented
 * shapes at the end of this file are what discriminate that: with the halves split on the `:`
 * token instead, a comment in any position is inert. A BLOCK comment before the condition is
 * the worst of them -- it reported the condition call as the MESSAGE and dropped the real
 * message, a wrong context rather than a missing row.
