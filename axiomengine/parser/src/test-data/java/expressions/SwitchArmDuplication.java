/**
 * Acceptance fixture for arrow arms of a switch used as a VALUE.
 *
 * `case 1 -> t();` is written as an expression_statement, and
 * `case 1 -> throw e;` as a throw_statement, whichever form the switch takes.
 * Collecting every expression statement therefore picked the arm up a second
 * time, once correctly as the arm's result and once again as a top-level
 * statement of the enclosing method. One written call site became two rows, and
 * the spurious one asserted a root context the source does not have: the arm's
 * value is the switch's value, not a statement in the method.
 *
 * The two forms are told apart by what the switch is attached to. A switch used
 * as a statement sits directly in a block; one used as a value sits under
 * whatever consumes it. Every consuming position is covered below, because the
 * distinction is made on the parent node and each parent is a different type.
 *
 * The statement form at the bottom is the control: there the arm really is a
 * statement, and its single row is correct and must stay.
