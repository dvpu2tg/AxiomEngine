/**
 * Acceptance fixture for the default constructor of JLS 8.8.9.
 *
 * A class that declares no constructor gets one implicitly, and it takes the
 * access of the class itself - a package-private class does not get a public
 * constructor. Interfaces and annotation types get none at all, which is the
 * half a "synthesise a constructor for every type" rule would get wrong.
 *
 * Per `javap -p`: Plain() is public, PackagePrivate() is package-private,
 * Abstract() is public, Declared has only Declared(int), and neither Contract
 * nor Marker has any constructor.
