 * Acceptance fixture for the members JLS 8.9 declares implicitly on an enum.

 * reports and what it does NOT, because both matter:
 *
 *   public static E[] values();          <- JLS 8.9.3, always implicit
 *   public static E valueOf(String);     <- JLS 8.9.3, always implicit
 *   private E();                         <- JLS 8.9.2, only when none declared
 *
 *   private static final E[] $VALUES;    <- class-file artifact, NOT extracted
 *   private static E[] $values();        <- class-file artifact, NOT extracted
 *   static {};                           <- constant initialiser, NOT extracted
 *
 * values() and valueOf(String) differ from a record's implicit members in that
 * they can never be written by hand - declaring either is a compile error - so
 * they are present on every enum below without exception.
