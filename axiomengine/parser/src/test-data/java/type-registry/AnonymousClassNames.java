/**
 * Acceptance fixture for anonymous class naming.
 *
 * An anonymous class is keyed by the type it extends or implements, as
 * `Outer$anon:Runnable`. The previous form numbered them `Outer$N` from the
 * running count of every type row emitted for the file, which had two problems:
 * the count included the enclosing type, so the first anonymous class was
 * `Outer$2`, and adding an unrelated NAMED nested type above renumbered every
 * anonymous type below it.
 *
 * The named nested types below are positioned deliberately: one before the
 * anonymous classes and one between them. Under the old scheme they shifted the
 * numbering of everything after them, so their presence here is what makes the
 * fixture discriminate on stability rather than only on the starting value.
 *
 * Identity is unaffected by any of this. The row's hash is position-derived, so
 * the two anonymous Runnables below are distinct rows that share a name, in the
 * same way two nested types can share a flattened qualified name.
