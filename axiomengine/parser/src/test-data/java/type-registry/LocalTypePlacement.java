/**
 * Acceptance fixture for TypePlacement.LOCAL_PLACEMENT (JLS 14.3).
 *
 * A local class is not a member of the enclosing type. INNER_PLACEMENT is not a
 * vaguer answer for one, it is a different and false one: the vocabulary defines
 * INNER_PLACEMENT as a non-static inner class WITH access to an outer instance.
 * A local class in a static method or a static initializer has no outer
 * instance, and a local record can never have one, so reporting INNER_PLACEMENT
 * for those states something the language forbids.
 *
 * What decides the answer is which scope is reached first walking outward: an
 * executable body makes the type local, an enclosing type declaration makes it a
 * member. The nested cases at the bottom are here to hold that ordering, because
 * a rule that simply asked "is there a method anywhere above me" would relabel
 * every member type of a local class as local too.
