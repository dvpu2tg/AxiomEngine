"""Generate decls_base_js.dl FROM the schema doc's own column tables.

Arities come out of the '### 3.N `js_x` / `lib_js_x` — N columns' headers and are
cross-checked against the numbered rows of each table, so the .dl cannot drift from
schema.json. Run with --check to diff instead of write (for CI).

Why generated: a hand-maintained .dl drifts silently. Column ORDER is the contract
with the Souffle engine, and the .dl carries only c0..cN — so a column rename is free
post-freeze and a reorder is not. Generating it is what makes that asymmetry safe.

//     lib_js_<entity>   external / third-party         <- the ENGINE stages these
//
// COLUMN ORDER IS THE CONTRACT. All columns are `symbol`. New columns append ONLY.
// The last column is the entity's own unique hash for every relation EXCEPT
// js_expression, js_method and js_field, which have columns appended AFTER their hash
// (js_expression c32 introducesDeclarationLinkHash and c33; js_method c36 and js_field c23
// computedNameExpressionLinkHash) because the schema was already frozen and appending
// is the only safe edit. So a check that locates a primary key BY POSITION is wrong
// for those three and must locate it by name. Column NAMES live only in the schema
// doc, so a rename is free after the freeze and a reorder is not.
//
// FIVE THINGS AN ENGINE AUTHOR MUST READ BEFORE JOINING ANYTHING:
//
//  1. THE MODULE GRAPH LIVES IN THE EXPRESSION RELATION. 83.6% of module edges are
//     expression-borne: require() is a call, module.exports = X is an assignment.
//     js_import/js_export rows are MINTED FROM js_expression in a second pass, and
//     js_import.edgeBearer partitions the table (2,300 files wholly EXPRESSION, 431
//     wholly DECLARATION, 0 mixed). 13.6% of require() calls are not even top-level.
//
//  2. THE PARSER RESOLVES NOTHING ACROSS FILES, AND CANNOT. The oracle itself —
//     tsc with checkJs — decides only 52.6% of call sites, because JavaScript types
//     are inferred, not declared (0.165% syntactic annotations). resolvedMethodLinkHash
//     and resolvedTypeLinkHash are TIER 3 and stay empty. What every row DOES carry is
//     the name as written, the import hop, and resolvedFilePath. That is the contract.
//
//  3. TYPES LIVE IN COMMENTS. 36.4% of parameters are typed by JSDoc and 0.165% by
//     syntax. js_type_reference is a TREE parsed out of comment text, isTypeOnly is
//     always true there, and 677 js_type rows have evidenceKind = COMMENT_ONLY —
//     declarations whose only evidence is a comment. None may reach the call graph.
//
//  4. NO lib_js_* ROW IS EVER STAGED. There is ONE ambient population and it is
//     provenance-tagged, not language-tagged: a lib row describes a declaration read
//     from a .d.ts, and whether a JavaScript or TypeScript call site references it is a
//     property of the CALL SITE -- but the parser stages NO pointer to one, because a
//     pointer to a specific lib row IS a resolved link and tier 3 forbids it. The row
//     carries the target NAME AS WRITTEN plus resolutionOutcome =
//     AMBIENT_BUILTIN_TARGET, and the ENGINE joins. This matters more than it sounds:
//     24.4% of all resolution declines are calls whose receiver is a Node builtin with
//     no ambient declarations.
//
//  5. HOISTING IS TWO COLUMNS, NOT ONE. js_variable.declarationScopeLinkHash is where
//     a name is VISIBLE FROM; syntacticScopeLinkHash is where it is WRITTEN. They
//     differ for every `var` in a block. js_scope is a real relation with a parent FK
//     because the binder, not the type system, is what resolves a name here.
