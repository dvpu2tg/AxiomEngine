"""Generate decls_base_ts.dl FROM the schema doc's own column tables.

Arities come out of the '### 4.N `ts_x` / `lib_ts_x` — N columns' headers and are
cross-checked against the numbered rows of each table, so the .dl cannot drift from
schema.json. Run with --check to diff instead of write (for CI).

Why generated: a hand-maintained .dl drifts silently. Column ORDER is the contract
with the Souffle engine, and the .dl carries only c0..cN — so a column rename is free
post-freeze and a reorder is not. Generating it is what makes that asymmetry safe.

// Base input relations — TYPESCRIPT parser IR. One relation pair per entity kind.
//
// GENERATED FROM schema.json BY gen_decls.py — DO NOT HAND-EDIT.
// Re-run `python3 gen_decls.py --check` in CI; drift here is a silent schema break.
//
// NAMING: one prefix per core language; `lib_` is the EXTERNAL marker on top of it.
// java_*/lib_* is PROVENANCE, not language: the project under analysis vs everything
// else. So:
//
//     ts_<entity>       TypeScript under analysis      <- the PARSER emits only these
//     lib_ts_<entity>   external / third-party         <- the ENGINE stages these
//
// COLUMN ORDER IS THE CONTRACT. All columns are `symbol`. New columns append ONLY.
// The last column is always the entity's own unique hash; serviceVersionLinkHash is
// immediately before it. Column NAMES live only in the schema doc, so a rename is
// free after the freeze and a reorder is not.
//
// THREE THINGS AN ENGINE AUTHOR MUST READ BEFORE JOINING ANYTHING:
//
//  1. `name -> single entity` IS FALSE. TypeScript merges declarations: one interface
//     name can have N declarations across N files (max 43 measured) that are ONE type.
//     ts_type/ts_method/ts_field are keyed PER DECLARATION SITE; the merged entity is
//     `declarationGroupKey`, which is deliberately NOT UNIQUE. Group on it. A rule that
//     assumes one row per name is wrong by construction.
//
//  2. INHERITANCE EDGES DO NOT CAPTURE SUBTYPING. TypeScript is structural: 60.4% of
//     classes satisfy their interfaces with no `implements` clause, and 21.5% of
//     assignable pairs appear in no syntax at all. ts_type_heritage.inheritsMembers
//     tells you whether an edge inherits members (`extends`) or merely asserts
//     (`implements`). For subtyping use ts_type_satisfies, which the ENGINE derives.
//
//  3. THE TYPE GRAPH IS NOT THE CALL GRAPH. Type aliases, interfaces, conditional /
//     mapped / template-literal types and `import type` have no runtime existence.
//     They are confined to ts_type_reference and flagged isTypeOnly wherever they can
//     be reached. ts_call_site.isTypeOnlyTarget must always be "false".
