/**
 * The directories git ignores under the tree being analysed, so that no walker reads them.
 *
 * Every walker in the parser skips a fixed list of names (node_modules, dist, .next, …). A generated tree
 * that only the repository's .gitignore names — a framework's build cache under another name, a vendored
 * bundle, a local export — was parsed as source: an index of a 431-file Next.js/TypeScript project read
 * 15,108 files and took 12 minutes. git already knows which directories are not the project, so it is asked
 * once per run:
 *
 *     git ls-files --others --ignored --exclude-standard --directory
 *
 * lists each ignored directory once (not its contents) and only when NOTHING under it is tracked, so a file
 * committed on purpose beneath an ignored name is still read, and so is everything outside a git work tree
 * (the command fails there, and nothing is skipped). Only directories are skipped, never single ignored
 * files: an ignored declaration file (`next-env.d.ts`) still contributes types. The background refresher
 * (plugins/axiomengine/skills/axiomengine/scripts/ax_fresh.py, git_ignored_dirs) asks the same question, so the
 * files it watches are the files the parser reads.
 *
 * Off for a library tree (`--library`: a dependency's own .gitignore names its build output, which for a
 * dependency is the source) and with AXIOMENGINE_NO_GITIGNORE=1.
