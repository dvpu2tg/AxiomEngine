/**
 * What counts as a platform module, in one place.
 *
 * ## Three copies of this list was the real risk
 *
 * `js-module-edge-extractor` used it to decide
 * `resolutionOutcome = RESOLVED_BUILTIN`, `js-expression-extractor` to decide
 * `receiverTypeSource = NODE_BUILTIN`, and `js-ir-completeness` reads the
 * results of both. They were byte-identical when this was extracted — checked,
 * not assumed — and nothing would have reported it if one had gained an entry
 * and the others had not.
 *
 * The failure that drift produces is not a missing row. It is a call site
 * saying `AMBIENT_BUILTIN_TARGET` while its own import row says
 * `RESOLVED_EXTERNAL`: two relations disagreeing about the same edge, both
 * populated, both plausible.
 *
 * ## Why the list decides something that matters
 *
 * **24.4% of the oracle's own declines** are calls whose receiver came from a
 * Node builtin with no ambient declarations. That is the single largest
 * environmental class in JavaScript — larger than missing `node_modules`, which
 * is 1.5% — and `js-oracle` classifies it as *environmental but unfixable*:
 * nothing installable in the repository under analysis supplies those
 * declarations.
 *
 * So the list is not a convenience. It is what separates "the engine should look
 * in `lib_*`" from "this package was not installed", and those are different
 * instructions to a consumer.
 *
 * ## Recognised by NAME, never resolved
 *
 * Resolving `path` needs `@types/node` present, and its **absence is the
 * measured condition** — `js-oracle` moved one web framework from 12.9% to 21.9% resolved
 * by forcing `types: ["node"]`. A parser whose classification depends on whether
 * someone installed a types package reports a property of the machine.

/**
 * The JavaScript extension a file name carries, ignoring a `.flow` suffix.
 *
 * ## `path.extname` returns the LAST part, and JavaScript is full of names with more
 *
 * This is the general form of a trap that has now bitten four different call
 * sites. `path.extname('a.js.flow')` is `.flow` — not `.js` — so:
 *
 * - the project walker tested `JS_SOURCE_EXTENSIONS.includes(extname(name))` and
 *   **never discovered a single Flow declaration file**, which made the
 *   extension half of the Flow detector unreachable code that read as supported;
 * - `package-json-resolver` tests `extname === '.mjs' || '.cjs'`, so
 *   `a.cjs.flow` misses the module-system override that `.cjs` is supposed to
 *   make TOTAL;
 * - `stemOf` and `stripExtension` both cut at the last dot, so `a.js.flow`
 *   produced `name = "a.js"` and `qualifiedName = "a.js"` — a name column
 *   carrying an extension.
 *
 * And fixing `.js.flow` by NAME rather than by class left the same hole one
 * layer out: `b.cjs.flow` was still never discovered, because the list held the
 * literal string `.js.flow` and nothing else. Flow's convention is
 * `<name>.<ext>.flow` shadowing `<name>.<ext>`, so `.cjs.flow`, `.mjs.flow` and
 * `.jsx.flow` are all legal and all were invisible.
 *
 * So the question every site actually wants to ask is this one: **what is this
 * file's JavaScript extension**, with a `.flow` suffix stripped first. One
 * function, and the multi-part handling happens once.
