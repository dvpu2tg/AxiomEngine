 * denominator — which is only checkable if the file is in the fact base saying
 * what it is. A silent directory skip and a classified row look identical in a
 * row count and are opposite claims.
 *
 * `vendor/` is also frequently hand-vendored real source rather than output, so

 * name marker is a real shape that is simply not in that corpus — and it will
