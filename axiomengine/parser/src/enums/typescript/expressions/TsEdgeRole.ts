/**
 * The edge from a parent expression to a child. In the PRIMARY KEY.
 *
 * In the key alongside `position` because two children of one parent can share
 * an index in different roles: a binary node's left and right operands are both
 * position 0 of their own role, and a call's callee and first argument likewise.
 *
 * ## The shape of a method call, which every resolution rule reads
 *
 * ```ts
 * a.b(c, d)
 * ```
 *
 * ```
 * CALL_EXPRESSION
 *   METHOD_NAME  → PROPERTY_ACCESS  (a.b)
 *                    RECEIVER       → IDENTIFIER_REFERENCE (a)
 *                    PROPERTY_NAME  → IDENTIFIER_REFERENCE (b)
 *   ARGUMENT 0   → IDENTIFIER_REFERENCE (c)
 *   ARGUMENT 1   → IDENTIFIER_REFERENCE (d)
 * ```
 *
 * `ts_call_site.receiverExpressionLinkHash` points at the RECEIVER — the
 * callee's child, and therefore the call's grandchild. That is why call sites are
 * emitted in a second pass, once every expression row exists.
 *
 * ## ROOT is not a child edge
 *
 * It marks the top of a tree, where `parentExpressionHash` is `""`. Every other
 * member implies a parent.
 *
 * Schema §4.14 c1.
