/**
 * Where the ROOT of an expression tree sits in the surrounding syntax.
 *
 * Inherited by every node in the tree, so a leaf can be filtered by the
 * statement that contains it without walking to the root. "Every call in a
 * condition", "every `new` in a field initializer" are one predicate each.
 *
 * ## Two contexts that carry behavioural weight
 *
 * `PARAMETER_DEFAULT` — the tree runs on every call that omits the argument, not
 * once. `FIELD_INITIALIZER` — the tree runs on every construction. A rule
 * counting allocations or side effects needs both, and neither is visible from
 * the expression's own kind.
 *
 * `DECORATOR_EXPRESSION` is where TypeScript departs from Java hardest: a Java
 * annotation is inert metadata, while a decorator is an expression that RUNS at
 * class-definition time and may REPLACE its target.
 *
 * Schema §4.14 c2.
