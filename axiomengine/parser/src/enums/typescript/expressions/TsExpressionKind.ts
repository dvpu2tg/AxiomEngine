/**
 * What kind of expression node this is.
 *
 * Positions 0–24 of `ts_expression` are byte-for-byte `java_expression` 0–24, so
 * `expr_kind`, `expr_child` and `expr_owner` port as renames and this enum
 * starts from Java's `ExpressionKind`.
 *
 * ## Members with no Java analogue, and why each is a separate kind
 *
 * ```ts
 * x as T           // AS_EXPRESSION       — a cast that WIDENS or NARROWS
 * x satisfies T    // SATISFIES_EXPRESSION — checks WITHOUT changing the type
 * <T>x             // TYPE_ASSERTION      — the older cast form; JSX in .tsx
 * x!               // NON_NULL_EXPRESSION — asserts non-null, changes nothing else
 * ...args          // SPREAD_ELEMENT      — argument positions become unknowable
 * import("m")      // DYNAMIC_IMPORT      — a module edge inside an expression
 * ```
 *
 * `AS_EXPRESSION` and `SATISFIES_EXPRESSION` are not interchangeable:
 * `as` changes the type the checker believes, `satisfies` asserts and leaves the
 * inferred type alone. A rule that treats them alike is wrong about which type
 * flows onward.
 *
 * ## PARENTHESIZED is deliberately ABSENT
 *
 * A parenthesised expression is punctuation, not a fact. Emitting a row for it
 * would put a node between a call and its receiver that no resolution rule
 * expects, so parentheses are transparent and the operand takes their place.
 * `(a).b()` therefore has exactly the shape of `a.b()`.
 *
 * ## JSX component elements are calls
 *
 * A JSX element whose tag names a component IS a call to it, with the whole
 * props object as argument 0: JSX_ELEMENT / JSX_SELF_CLOSING, 1:1 with a call
 * site, with the tag as its METHOD_NAME child. Attribute values and children are
 * rooted as their own JSX_EMBEDDED_EXPRESSION trees. An intrinsic element emits
 * no row.
 *
 * Schema §4.14 c0, §4.15.1.
