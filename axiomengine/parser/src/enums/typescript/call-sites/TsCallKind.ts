/**
 * What kind of call this is.
 *
 * ## Examples
 *
 * ```ts
 * f(x)                  // FUNCTION_CALL
 * a.b(x)                // METHOD_CALL
 * ops[name](x)          // METHOD_CALL  — a computed member is still a member
 * new C(x)              // CONSTRUCTOR_CALL
 * super(x)              // SUPER_CALL
 * super.m(x)            // METHOD_CALL  with receiverKind SUPER
 * tag`a${b}`            // TAGGED_TEMPLATE_CALL
 * a?.b(x)               // OPTIONAL_CALL
 * import("m")           // DYNAMIC_IMPORT_CALL
 * @Component({ … })     // DECORATOR_CALL
 * ```
 *
 * ## OPTIONAL_CALL is a kind, not a flag
 *
 * `a?.b()` and `a.b()` have the SAME target and different reachability. A rule
 * that treats them alike is right about the target and wrong about whether the
 * call happens, so the distinction is in the kind where a rule cannot miss it.
 *
 * ## INDEX_CALL is a resolution outcome, never read from syntax
 *
 * A computed callee is `METHOD_CALL`: `ops[name](a, b)` calls a member and the
 * brackets only mean the name is computed. `INDEX_CALL` is reserved for a call
 * that resolved THROUGH AN INDEX SIGNATURE, which is a fact about the receiver's
 * TYPE. Syntax cannot tell the two apart, so syntax does not try.
 *
 * ## JSX_COMPONENT_CALL — `<Badge/>` is a call to Badge
 *
 * A JSX element whose tag names a binding IS a call to its component, with the
 * whole props object as argument 0 and children folded into the `children`
 * prop, because a component has exactly one parameter and mapping attributes
 * positionally would be wrong. An intrinsic element (`<div>`) names no
 * declaration and produces no site; a member tag (`<ui.Card/>`) is a
 * METHOD_CALL on its receiver.
 *
 * Schema §4.15 c0, §4.15.1.
