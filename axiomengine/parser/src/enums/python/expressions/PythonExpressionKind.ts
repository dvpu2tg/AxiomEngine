/**
 * The kind of a Python expression node.
 *
 * ## There is deliberately no `OBJECT_CREATION`
 *
 * This is the one omission worth explaining, because Java has it and its
 * absence is a modelling decision rather than an oversight. Python has no `new`:
 * `User(1)` and `helper(1)` are the *same syntax*, and which one constructs an
 * object depends on whether `User` happens to name a class — which is exactly
 * the question the engine exists to answer. Splitting them in the parser would
 * mean guessing, and guessing wrong produces a call graph that looks precise and
 * is not. So every call is a `CALL`, and `py_call_site.resolvedCalleeKind`
 * records what we could honestly determine.
 *
 * Schema v6 §2.15 c0, §4.5.

/**
 * RESERVED, and deliberately never emitted. Audited on a corpus exercising every
 * construct: 32 of the 35 kinds below carry rows; these three do not, because the
 * information they would carry is already on another column and a second
 * representation could disagree with the first.
 *
 *   STARRED / DOUBLE_STARRED  `f(*a, **k)` emits the OPERAND with
 *                             edgeRole=STAR_ARGUMENT / DOUBLE_STAR_ARGUMENT and
 *                             isStarred=true. A wrapper row would duplicate the
 *                             operand at an identical span.
 *   MATCH_PATTERN             a pattern emits its own expression with
 *                             edgeRole=MATCH_PATTERN. tree-sitter wraps every
 *                             pattern element in its own `case_pattern`, so a row
 *                             per wrapper duplicated its child at an identical
 *                             span -- ten duplicates on one fixture.
 *
 * If you are auditing for declared-but-unemitted enum values, these three are the
 * answer; the rest should all carry rows.
