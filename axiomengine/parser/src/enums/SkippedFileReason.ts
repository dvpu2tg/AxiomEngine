   * A Python-2-only construct was detected, so the file was rejected wholesale.

   * `exec_statement` and `chevron` nodes, so `print "x"` yields a clean tree
   * with `hasError === false`. Emitting facts from it would silently apply
   * Python 3 scoping semantics to Python 2 source. Rejection is therefore
   * explicit, and the offending construct and span are recorded rather than
