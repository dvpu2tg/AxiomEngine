/**
 * Every emitted relation must survive a STRICT RFC4180 reader.
 *
 * A relation either loads or it does not. Souffle rejects the whole fact file
 * on the first malformed cell, so ONE bad value anywhere in a project removes
 * every fact of that relation from the solve. The failure is total, and it is
 * silent in the worst way: field typing simply stops existing for the entire
 * codebase because one annotation somewhere was a forward reference.
 *
 * That is what makes this different from an accuracy bug. A wrong value costs
 * one fact. An unquoted value costs the relation.
 *
 * The trigger was `fieldBaseType`. It is derived by cutting the annotation at
 * the first `[`, and a PEP 484 forward reference carries its quotes in the
 * annotation TEXT, so `value: "Union[str, bytes]"` produced `"Union` -- a cell
 * beginning with a quote and not quoted as a whole, which is invalid CSV. The
 * reader treats the leading quote as opening a quoted field and fails at the
 * next separator.
 *
 * Two things are therefore asserted, because fixing either one alone leaves the
 * other live:
 *
 *   1. the value is SEMANTICALLY right -- `Union`, not `"Union`, since nothing
 *      downstream can match a type whose name contains a quote;
 *   2. the file is STRUCTURALLY loadable -- every cell that needs quoting has
 *      it, so a value that can begin with a quote cannot tear the relation.
 *
 * The reader below is deliberately strict and hand-written rather than lenient:
 * a forgiving parser would accept files Souffle rejects, which is precisely the
 * failure this exists to catch.
