/**
 * A qualified name is stable across independent runs.
 *
 * The parser has no notion of a client or a library. It is run over a tree and
 * emits one IR; whether those CSVs are later staged under a `lib_` prefix is a
 * decision made downstream, and nothing here should encode it. What the parser
 * owes is narrower and purely its own: the name it mints for a module must not
 * depend on anything outside the module's own position in its package.
 *
 * That matters because hashes are content-addressed per run, so two runs cannot
 * share them. Anything joining one run's output to another's joins BY NAME. The
 * name is therefore a cross-run contract even though the parser never sees more
 * than one run at a time -- which is exactly why no existing gate could observe
 * it: every one of them analyses a single tree.
 *
 * Three properties, none of which mentions a role:
 *
 * 1. SELF-CONSISTENCY. What an import STATES and what a module row OFFERS are
 *    produced by different code, and must agree. `from mylib.core.engine import
 *    Engine` is only ever joinable if a module named `mylib.core.engine` is
 *    what the same tree emits.
 *
 * 2. ROOT INDEPENDENCE. Pointing the parser at a package or at its parent must
 *    give the same names. The run is invoked by whoever has the directory, and
 *    a name that moved with the root would produce an IR that joins to nothing
 *    for half of them.
 *
 * 3. DISTINCT IDENTITY. Two different files must never hash alike. `extract`
 *    passes rootDir PER DETECTED PROJECT and one baseMservPath for the
 *    repository, so a repo holding src/ and tests/ analyses each separately.
 *    With filePath recorded relative to the analysis root both became
 *    `main.py`, and with neither directory a package the qualified name
 *    collapsed to `main` for both, so every hash input matched. Fact files load
 *    with SET semantics, so the IR then held one module where the source has
 *    two, and their methods merged into it. Nothing downstream could separate
 *    them: filePath, qualifiedName and hash were all equal.
 *
 * 4. VISIBLE ABSENCE. A tree that imports something it does not contain must
 *    not invent a module row for it, and must mark the import UNRESOLVED rather
 *    than guess. Absence is a fact: every row traces to bytes that were parsed,
 *    and what is missing has to be readable as missing.
 *
 * The `.pyi` spelling is exercised alongside `.py` for the same reason the
 * extension is not allowed to change a name anywhere else -- not because a stub
 * tree is a different KIND of input, but because it is the same input written
 * differently, and it is where this broke before: a stub package emitted
 * `collections.__init__` while every importer writes `collections`.
