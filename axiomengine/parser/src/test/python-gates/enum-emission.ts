/**
 * Every enum value the schema DECLARES must have code that can produce it.
 *
 * The defect chain so far has been reactive: the engine consumes the IR, gets a
 * wrong answer, and someone traces it back. That process can only find facts
 * that are WRONG. It cannot find facts that are ABSENT, because from the
 * consumer side an absent classification is indistinguishable from one that
 * does not apply. Nobody files an issue about a value they have never seen.
 *
 * So this looks the other way round: for each value declared in an enum under
 * `src/enums/python`, is there any code outside the enum declarations and the
 * tests that constructs it? A value nothing constructs is a promise the schema
 * makes and the parser does not keep. Consumers write rules against the
 * declared surface, so a permanently absent value is a rule that never fires.
 *
 * ## Why this is static and not corpus-driven
 *
 * Running a corpus and collecting the values it happens to emit answers a
 * different and much weaker question, because a value can be missing simply
 * because the corpus lacks the construct. Measured while writing this: of 128
 * values absent from a 124-file stdlib slice, 73 were emitted by code and only
 * absent from that sample -- `STUB` needs a `.pyi`, `FIELD_TYPE` needs a class
 * annotation, `futureImports` needs a `__future__` import. Corpus absence is
 * evidence of nothing. Whether a code path EXISTS is decidable from the source
 * alone, needs no corpus, no interpreter and no network, and cannot drift with
 * whatever files a fixture happens to contain.
 *
 * ## Ratchet, not a pass/fail bar
 *
 * The count is pinned and may fall, never rise. Lowering the bar means deleting
 * a name from the list below, which is a reviewable act. Adding a new enum
 * value with no producer fails immediately, which is the case worth catching:
 * the schema and the parser drifting apart at the moment the schema grows.
