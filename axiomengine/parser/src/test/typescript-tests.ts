 * NO ts.Program, NO TypeChecker, NO NETWORK. Every check compares against
 * expectations frozen into src/test-data/typescript/_oracle, so this works anywhere
 * the project builds and it cannot be talked into a different answer.
 *

 * pinned typescript@6.0.3. That lives in ../parser-oracle/typescript. Reach for it
 * only when a check here fails AND you believe the new behaviour is right.
 *
 * The split is the point. A suite that can rewrite its own expectations has a failure
 * mode indistinguishable from success — red, re-bless, green, with the defect now
 * recorded as intended, and every later fix reading as a regression. This file can
 * DETECT drift and cannot AUTHORISE it.
 *
 * It now imports the PARSER, because four of its checks compare parser output against
 * the frozen expectations and there is no way to do that without running it. The
 * property that mattered is unchanged and is worth restating exactly: NOTHING here
 * constructs a `ts.Program` or a `TypeChecker`, so nothing here can recompute an
 * expectation. The parser cannot either — that is its own hardest rule — which is
 * why importing it does not hand this suite the ability to re-bless itself.

/**
 * A discovered project is not one program. A monorepo root's tsconfig claims
 * only the files at the top, and every package below it is a separate program
 * with its own global scope — so analysing the root alone reached 24 of 965
 * files on one real repository, and the other 941 were extracted by nothing.
 *
 * Two things have to hold at once here, and they pull against each other.
 *
 *   EVERY PROGRAM IS EXTRACTED, into one flat relation set, as Java's
 *   multi-project run produces. That is the fix.
 *
 *   THE PROGRAMS ARE STILL SEPARATE, which merging the OUTPUT must not
 *   undo. The module link passes run within one program, so an import in
 *   program B must NOT resolve to an ambient module declared in program A.
 *   Running those passes across the merged facts would link them, and that is
 *   precisely the global-scope merge `tsc` does not do. A test that only
 *   counted rows would pass while this was broken.
