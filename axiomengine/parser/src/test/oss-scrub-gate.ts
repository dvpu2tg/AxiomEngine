 *     npx tsx src/test/oss-scrub-gate.ts --inventory     write the inventory beside the private denylist
 *
 * Every mode but --self-test needs `JS_SCRUB_DENYLIST=<path>`: the token list
 * is PRIVATE and lives outside every repository (see below). Without it the
 * gate refuses rather than scanning with an empty list and reporting clean.
 *
 * ## The inventory is an ARTEFACT, written by this instrument, at a SHA
 *
 * Five repo-wide counts from four agents existed at once — 144, 104, 140, 82,
 * 57 — none wrong through carelessness. They were taken at different moments
 * with different pattern sets, and every one lived in a message. One of them,
 * sent to two owners as their targets, described a tree that had already been
 * scrubbed by a commit the sender had not yet merged. A number nobody can
 * re-derive is not a measurement.
 *
 * So `--inventory` writes an inventory: the commit and TREE it was taken at,
 * the denylist's size and digest, totals by subtree and owner, and every hit
 * as file:line with its category. Owners run `--scope` and reconcile against
 * it; nobody greps.
 *
 * It is NOT in the tree. It was, as `src/test/OSS-SCRUB-INVENTORY.md`, and a
 * committed list of where the leaks are is itself a map for a reader of the
 * published repository — the human removed it from main. It is written beside
 * the private denylist (the directory of `$JS_SCRUB_DENYLIST`), which is the
 * home of everything this gate must not publish, and its stamp is the tree
 * hash, which a squash preserves.
 *
 * ## A grep is a claim; a committed check is a guarantee
 *
 * This repository is going open source. A one-time scrub finds today's names;
 * the next fixture, comment or commit reintroduces one and nobody knows. So the
 * denylist lives here, the walk is over `git ls-files` — the set that actually
 * ships — and a hit is a non-zero exit with file and line.
 *
 * The merge to main is a squash. That keeps intermediate commits out of main's
 * history and does NOTHING about the tree: a squash publishes the final tree in
 * one commit instead of forty. This gate is a tree operation.
 *
 * ## What is on the list, and what is deliberately not
 *
 * Names of corpora and benchmarks we MEASURED AGAINST. Real build dependencies
 * are not on it — `typescript` and `tree-sitter` are what this parser is made
 * of, not what it was measured against — and neither are technical terms that
 * happen to be product names (`eslint` names a directive kind that exists in
 * the language, `moment` is a word). Matching is on word boundaries, case-
 * insensitive, so `Zorbulon`, `zorbulon-dom` and `prezorbulon` would be three
 * entries and `zorbulonic` is not a hit.
 *
 * Replace, do not delete: "894 references lost in one package" is still the
 * finding. The package name is the problem.

/**
 * Word-boundary tokens. Extend by owner; every language's corpora belong here.
 *
 * ## Tokens that name a DEPENDENCY are excluded BY CONSTRUCTION
 *
 * A corpus was named `vite`; `vitest` is a real devDependency and `vite` is in
 * its dependency graph. A gate cannot tell "what we were measured against" from
 * "what we are made of" by spelling, so a token in both is unusable — and vite
 * will not be the last. The rule is therefore derived at runtime, not
 * hand-maintained: every package name in `package.json`'s dependency graph, as
 * resolved by `package-lock.json`, is removed from the denylist before the scan
 * and the exclusion is PRINTED. A hand-kept exception list would be the
 * shared-string defect again — a list that is right until the next install.
 *
 * `vite` is listed below on purpose, so the derivation is exercised on every
 * run: if it ever stops being a dependency, the token goes live automatically.
 */
/**
 * DOCUMENTS THAT DESCRIBE THE SCRUB ARE SCANNED WITH THE SAME PATTERNS AS SOURCES.
 *
 * This is not an obvious rule and it was learned three times independently before
 * anyone wrote it down:
 *
 *   - a fixtures MANIFEST named a UI library as an example of "a bare word excluded",
 *     inside the very section documenting the scrub;
 *   - a scrub log quoted the name it had just removed;
 *   - a schema document's prose, explaining a regex false positive, contained the
 *     literal package name it was explaining.
 *
 * All three survived a careful manual pass and two censuses, and all three fell to
 * this gate in one run. The reason they survive human review is that IN A DOCUMENT
 * ABOUT THE SCRUB, A NAME READS AS A CITATION RATHER THAN A REFERENCE — the reader's
 * eye classifies it as an example of the thing rather than an instance of it. A
 * publication tarball does not draw that distinction.
 *
 * So: no exemption for documentation, for changelogs, for manifests, or for the
 * scrub's own records. A sentence about a leak is still a leak.
 *
 * COMMIT MESSAGES ARE OUT OF SCOPE and deliberately so: the merge to main is a
 * SQUASH, so intermediate messages never reach the published history. TRACKED PROSE
 * IS IN SCOPE, because it ships as-is. The distinction is what the tree carries, not
 * what the history remembers.
 */
/**
 * THE DENYLIST IS NOT IN THE TREE.
 *
 * It was, and it published exactly what it existed to hide: every corpus
 * member's name and both holdout organisations, in plain text, twenty lines
 * below the comment saying a holdout's entire value is that it is unnamed —
 * found by js-corpus's second opinion, a scan derived from the private
 * identity rather than from a token list, which this gate could not see
 * because it excluded its own list. A plain-text list conceals less than the
 * bare hash the human had already ruled conceals nothing.
 *
 * So the list lives beside the private corpus identity, outside every
 * repository, and is read from `$JS_SCRUB_DENYLIST`: one token per line, `#`
 * comments, and a second word `ambiguous` for a token that is also ordinary
 * English or a code identifier (a verb, a noun, a two-character fixture
 * identifier) and is matched only where it names a package —
 * quoted, capitalised as a proper noun, or in a path or specifier. The gate
 * FAILS LOUDLY when the variable is unset or the file is missing: the same
 * design as `$JS_CORPUS_IDENTITY`, and the reason it is a design rather than
 * an omission. The inventory records the list's size and digest, never a
 * token. `--self-test` writes its own synthetic list and needs nothing.
 *
 * What stays in the tree names no corpus member: benchmark families and
 * infrastructure hosts that a shared lesson may cite.
