/**
 * JAVASCRIPT TESTS — one file, mirroring `typescript-tests.ts` and
 * `python-tests.ts`.
 *
 *     npx tsx src/test/javascript-tests.ts            # everything
 *     npx tsx src/test/javascript-tests.ts --list     # what runs, and what it proves
 *
 * NO `ts.Program`, NO `TypeChecker`, NO NETWORK. Deciding what an expectation
 * SHOULD be needs a Program, a checker and the pinned `typescript@6.0.3`; that
 * lives in `../parser-oracle/javascript`. This file can DETECT drift and cannot
 * AUTHORISE it — a suite that can rewrite its own expectations has a failure
 * mode indistinguishable from success: red, re-bless, green, with the defect now
 * recorded as intended and every later fix reading as a regression.
 *
 * ## Why the corpus is written into a temp directory by the suite itself
 *
 * `src/test-data/javascript/` belongs to `js-fixtures`, and a durable regression
 * corpus is that agent's deliverable. What the gates below need is different and
 * smaller: inputs whose *shape* the check is about, so the check can be made to
 * fail on purpose. Those are written here, next to the assertion they serve, and
 * they are scaffolding rather than fixtures. When `src/test-data/javascript/`
 * exists the suite extracts it too and runs every structural gate over it.
 *
 * ## The meta-rule, applied
 *
 * §11 of `BUILDING-A-PARSER.md`: *before trusting a null result, make the check
 * produce a non-null one on purpose.* Three of the most expensive errors in this
 * repository were checks incapable of returning anything but "clean". So the
 * integrity gate has a paired negative case that corrupts a copy of the output
 * and asserts the gate rejects it, and every per-file assertion is paired with a
 * non-vacuity assertion that the corpus actually exercises it.

 * `unescapeTsv` was applied by hand at the one site known to need it. An audit

 * more that did not, and both were passing:
 *
 * - **`call-site 1:1`** asked `row[text].startsWith('require(')`. `text` is
 *   escaped whenever it contains a double quote, so `require("./x")` — the
 *   ordinary spelling — has a raw field beginning with a quote and the test said
 *   no. The check was blind to the majority of the edges it exists to assert
 *   about, on every corpus, silently.
 * - **`row paths are self-consistent`** compares `fileName` against a real
 *   `path.basename`. Latent rather than firing, but the same shape: a raw field
 *   against an unescaped literal.
 *
 * Auditing 26 checks finds today's instances. Unescaping in the primitive means
 * a check CANNOT have the bug, which is the difference §3 draws between fixing
 * an instance and fixing a cause.
 *
 * ## And it must happen exactly once, because the operation is not idempotent
 *
 * A cell holding the literal text `"hello"` is written with the quotes doubled
 * and the whole wrapped again. Unescaping once yields `"hello"`; unescaping
 * twice yields `hello` — a different value, silently. That is why the explicit
 * call at the one site was REMOVED rather than left in place as harmless.
 *
 * The byte-level checks deliberately do not come through here: `determinism`,
 * `no emitted value can split a row` and `column order matches the frozen
 * schema` assert properties of the bytes on disk, and unescaping would destroy
 * the very thing they test.

/**
 * Every declared enum value is either emitted or on the reserved allowlist.
 *
 * ## Why this catches what nothing else does
 *
 * On TypeScript this found **four real defects no other check caught**, because
 * every one was a *classification* error that lost no rows: `@Get("/x")` emitted
 * as `FUNCTION_CALL`, `outer: for (…)` dropping its label, and two block kinds
 * producing no row at all. Recall, completeness and oracle adjudication were all
 * green for three of them.
 *
 * **A correctly-positioned row with the wrong kind is invisible to every
 * count-based check you have.**
 *
 * ## The audit's own false-positive mode is guarded
 *
 * `MODULE_EXPORTS` looked unemitted in TypeScript because it is a PREFIX
 * (`MODULE_EXPORTS:<hash>`) and exact-cell matching cannot see it; `N.M.K` looked
 * dropped until the column turned out to be `completeTypeName`. So the scan
 * compares against every cell of every relation rather than against a column
 * list, and reports the relation a value was found in.

  // The UNION of every corpus extracted this run. Running it over the scaffold
  // alone was a real gap: a reserved value that only REAL code produces is
  // invisible to a fifteen-file scaffold, and that is exactly what happened —

  // emitted it. An audit that cannot see the population it is auditing reports
  // a clean result it has no basis for.
  // PER (relation, column), not per cell.
  //
  // ## The third false-positive mode, and the one that hid the most
  //
  // The audit compared each declared value against every cell of every
  // relation. 35 of 264 distinct strings are declared in more than one enum:
  // `NONE` belongs to TEN of them, `FIELD` to four, `JSDOC` to four, `MODULE` to
  // three. One emitter anywhere marked all of them covered — so an enum could be
  // scored complete entirely on another enum's evidence.
  //
  // Whole-cell over the same corpora found 2 gaps. Column-scoped found 7. Five
  // were invisible, and two of those five are zero-row columns with a working
  // control in the same relation. This is §4 one level up: a correctly-emitted
  // value in the WRONG ENUM'S COLUMN passes the audit.
  //

  //

 * collide. It has no false positives, because a repeated binding is impossible
 * in legal source — `const { a: x, b: x }` is a redeclaration error.
 *

 *
 * §4's argument for the enum audit applies unchanged one level down: a column
 * that is never populated has three possible explanations and you cannot tell
 * them apart without looking — a real gap, a deliberate reservation, or a
 * property of the corpus. Run over 816 real files, this found **ten** columns
 * that were simply never filled, including `js_type_heritage.importLinkHash` and
 * `resolvedFilePath` — two of the three hops §0 says make a row complete, on the
 * relation that records inheritance.
 *
 * So the allowlist below is the claim, and anything outside it fails. A column
 * that stops being populated shows up as a named failure rather than as rows
 * nobody looked at.
 *
 * The check runs over the **corpus** when one is given, because the scaffold is
 * too small to populate a column like `isReadonly` and would therefore report
 * half the schema as unfilled.

 * A type's members are counted once, and only members are owned by it.

 * ## Two defects, one of which was found by the other
 *
 * `js-oracle` asked, after ruling that a class field holding an arrow emits
 * BOTH a `js_field` and a `js_method`: confirm `declaredMemberCount` counts it
 * once. It did not — a five-member class reported **seven**, because the field
 * was counted in `node.members.length` and again when the method row was
 * minted. `countMember` exists for members discovered by assignment OUTSIDE the
 * class body, which are genuinely not in `node.members`.
 *
 * Checking that turned up the larger one. `ownerTypeLinkHash` was inherited into
 * method BODIES, so every anonymous callable nested in a method read as a member
 * of the enclosing class — **2,422 phantom members over 816 real files.** An
 * engine listing a type's methods got a list of `<arrow>` entries that are not
 * members of anything; `enclosingMethodLinkHash` is the link that says where
 * they actually live.
 *

 * Nine `CONSTRUCTOR_THIS_ASSIGNMENT` fields sat outside their owner. Not a leak
 * — a name-keyed index. `typeByName` is first-wins across a whole file, and a
 * bundle containing both `class Parser` and a later `function Parser` put the

 * TypeScript and mis-parses it where it diverges — silently. One cause, three
 * faces: 3,793 parameters carrying `SYNTACTIC_FLOW` indistinguishable from
 * TypeScript annotations, `declare function` minting type-only `NO_BODY` method
 * rows into the call graph, and a recovery cascade duplicating diagnostics. And
 * of 248 `@flow` files, **zero** parsed cleanly.
 *
 * So Flow is declined. What this asserts is that declining is not the same as
 * skipping: the module row EXISTS and says `FLOW_REJECTED`, so a consumer can
 * count what was refused. §9's nested-config failure was a silent structural exclusion
 * of 1,270 of 1,821 files, and a run that reported success.
 *
 * The zero-rows half matters as much. The module row alone means nothing
 * downstream can read a Flow annotation as a TypeScript one by forgetting to

 * extensions and FIVE assumed one part — including this suite's own name check,
 * which then failed a parser that had become right. Collapsing them to
 * `jsExtensionOf` fixed those six.
 *
 * It was still not "they all call it now". Four more turned up on the next

 * `a.cjs.flow`, the one file most able to break the rule it guards — the
 * JSX-in-plain-`.js` counter beside it, and an EIGHTH spelling written into the
 * AST-recall harness during the very session that collapsed the other seven.
 *

 *    multi-part form. Adding `.js.flow` to the list must make all four answer
 *    together — that is the "picked up by all consumers" property, and it is
 *    checked against the real functions rather than a restatement of them.
 * 2. **SOURCE-LEVEL.** No file under the JavaScript paths may compare a file
 *    name against a known JavaScript extension except through the util. This is

 * the column was non-empty. This is the gap those checks have in common: a link
 * that is populated, resolvable and WRONG is invisible to both.
 *
 * So this asserts what the column MEANS, by kind: a callable's body scope is a

/**
 * Every FK column has a MEANING assertion, or is named as having only integrity.
 *
 * ## The blind spot, and its size
 *
 * `js_method.bodyScopeLinkHash` was the enclosing scope on every row since the
 * first commit. Every value was a valid scope hash, so the FK gate passed; the
 * sufficiency report counted it as carried because it asked only non-empty. A
 * link that is populated, resolvable and WRONG is the one shape both have a
 * blind spot for — and every other link column checked only for those two
 * properties was sitting in the same spot for the whole project.
 *
 * So this enumerates all 84 populated FK columns and asserts, for each one it
 * can, what the link MEANS, in four families:
 *
 * - NAME: the linked row's name equals a column on the source row
 *   (`resolvedBindingLinkHash` → a variable named `referencedName`).
 * - KIND: the linked row is of the kind the column claims
 *   (`moduleInitMethodLinkHash` → a MODULE_INITIALIZER).
 * - STRUCTURE: parent/child depth agree; a parameter's scope is its method's
 *   body scope; a root has no parent and a non-root has one.
 * - POSITION: a comment attached to a row ends before the row starts.
 *
 * The rest are printed BY NAME as integrity-only, with the reason, so the
 * residue is enumerable on demand rather than a percentage. A column that
 * gains a meaning check moves off that list; one that stops being checked
 * appears on it.
