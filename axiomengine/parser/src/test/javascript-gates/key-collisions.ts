/**
 * WHICH INTERNAL INDEX KEYS ARE NOT UNIQUE?
 *
 *     npx tsx src/test/javascript-gates/key-collisions.ts <corpus-root>
 *
 * A MEASUREMENT, not a gate, because most of these collisions are LEGAL
 * JavaScript. Two functions of the same name in one module is a bundle, not a
 * defect, and a check that forbade it would be wrong rather than strict. What
 * the numbers give is the blast radius of each under-specified key, which is
 * what decides whether it is worth fixing.
 *
 * ## Why this exists: it is a CLASS, not three incidents
 *
 * Three under-specified keys turned up one at a time, each found by a different
 * route and each looking like a one-off:
 *
 * - `js_parse_gap`'s PRIMARY KEY was `(module, kind, line, column)`, so a
 *   compiler that repeats a diagnostic produced duplicate PKs — and a duplicate
 *   does not collide, it DOUBLES.
 * - `typeByName` was first-wins across a file, so a bundle holding
 *   `class Parser` and a later `function Parser` put the second's members on the
 *   first, outside its own line span.
 * - `js_import.boundVariableLinkHash` is keyed on `(module, localName)`, so a
 *   later binding of that name takes the link. js-corpus measured 92.
 *
 * The third is what turns it into a sweep: a key that is a TUPLE OF NAMES is
 * unique only as long as the names are, and JavaScript does not promise that
 * anywhere. So every name-keyed index in the front end is enumerated here and
 * measured, rather than argued about one at a time.
 *
 * ## What it finds, over 4,561 files
 *
 * Four indexes, all of them colliding:
 *
 * | index | colliding keys | shadowed rows |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `declarationTargetByName` (free methods) | 570 | 3,999 |
 * | `typeByName` | 252 | 659 |
 * | `importByLocalName` | 57 | 92 |
 * | `accessorFieldByOwnerAndName` | 4 | 5 |
 *
 * The `importByLocalName` figure of 92 was derived here independently and
 * matches js-corpus's 92 of 16,812 exactly, which is the useful kind of
 * agreement: two different routes to the same number.
 *
 * `accessorFieldByOwnerAndName` is the one whose cause is not name reuse. Its
 * key is `ownerHash:name` with **no `isStatic`** — so a static and an instance
 * accessor of one name are two members under one key — and its measured
 * collisions are all COMPUTED-name accessors, which every one of them reports as
 * the empty string, so `get [a]()` and `get [b]()` on one class are
 * indistinguishable to it.
 *
 * ## Not fixed here
 *
 * Every one of these is filed and queued. A "shadowed row" is not automatically
 * a wrong row either — for `declarationTargetByName` it matters only when the
 * shadowed name is also exported, and the export gate already passes, so the
 * upper bound and the actual defect count are different numbers. Sizing them is
 * what this tool is for.
