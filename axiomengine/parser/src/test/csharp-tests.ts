 * **NO Roslyn, NO `dotnet`, NO network.** This suite runs the parser and checks
 * structural invariants of what it emits. Deciding what the expectations SHOULD
 * be needs Roslyn, and that lives out of process in `../parser-oracle/csharp`.
 *
 * The split is the point. A suite that can rewrite its own expectations has a
 * failure mode indistinguishable from success — red, re-bless, green, with the
 * defect now recorded as intended and every later fix reading as a regression.
 * This file can DETECT drift and cannot AUTHORISE it.
 *
 * ## Every check here has been made to fail on purpose
 *
 * §11: *"the most expensive errors in this repo were checks that returned
 * 'clean' because they were incapable of returning anything else."* So each
 * check below carries a NEGATIVE CONTROL — a deliberately broken input it must
 * reject — and the control runs in the same pass as the check. A gate whose
 * negative control stops failing has itself broken, and that is reported as a
 * failure rather than as a pass.

/**
 * A TOP-LEVEL STATEMENT PRECEDES EVERY DECLARATION — that is the language rule,
 * and it is what tells a real top-level program from recovery debris.
 *
 * C# allows top-level statements in one file of a project and requires them to
 * come BEFORE every namespace and type declaration in it. So a
 * `global_statement` that FOLLOWS one is not a statement the language permits
 * there: it is error recovery having ejected something from the declaration
 * above it. Measured in source-generator-B: three library files were flagged as
 * top-level programs, and what had been ejected was METHOD DECLARATIONS —
 * `Task InternalStopListeningAsync(…) { … }` at file scope after a sealed
 * partial class. Two `<Main>$` methods and two synthesised `Program` types in
 * files that contain neither.
 *
 * The file-scope method here is the same shape and the grammar accepts it with
 * NO error, which is what makes the syntactic rule the right instrument: asking
 * whether the file has a parse gap would keep this one and reject nothing.
 *
 * And `cs_module.hasTopLevelStatements` is asserted against the method row,
 * because it was a THIRD reading of the question and disagreed with the other
 * two — three modules said true where two entry points existed.

/**
 * THE TORTURE CORPUS — one fixture per shape the published grammar gets wrong,

 *
 * Every other front end here has one (`src/test-data/python/torture*`). C# had
 * fixtures for what it supports and nothing for what it does not, which is the
 * half that decides whether a fact base can be trusted.
 *
 * Generated from `KNOWN_GRAMMAR_LIMITATIONS`, so the corpus and the gate cannot
 * drift apart — a shape can only be in one by being in the other.
 *
 * Two assertions, by kind, because the two failure modes are not comparable:
 *
 *   ERROR     the file must produce a `cs_parse_gap` row. The rows are lost and
 *             the loss is RECORDED. That is an acceptable state; a silent one
 *             is not.
 *   MISPARSE  the node a correct parse yields must be absent. This is the
 *             repairable set, and each entry is a standing statement of work:
 *             when an extractor repair lands, its assertion flips and the entry
 *             moves out of this list.
 *
 * It also asserts the corpus is NOT EMPTY and that every manifest entry has a
 * file on disk. A torture suite that silently stops loading its fixtures
 * reports OK about nothing, which is the failure this whole file is written
 * against.

/**
 * A misparsed ref-returning assignment mints no phantom locals.

 * of type `Local`. No error is raised. ~3,400 call sites carried this shape
 * across the corpus.
 *
 * THE CONTROLS ARE THE POINT OF THIS CHECK. A detector keyed on "a declarator
 * holding a tuple pattern" would rewrite legitimate deconstructions and invent
 * calls the source never wrote, and inventing an edge is worse than losing one.
 * So the legitimate shapes are asserted UNTOUCHED, and they outnumber the

 *   int x = 1;             an ordinary declaration
 *   (p, q) = Pair();       already an assignment; never a declaration

 * MEASURED boundary is content-dependent:
 *
 *   a block with two or more members   recovers as a constructor with a `block`

 *   a GENERIC block, `extension<T>(…)` does not — not detected at all
 *
 * So a file mixing the two has blocks the pass can read and blocks it cannot,
 * and blanking only the readable ones is WORSE than blanking none: the
 * unflattened block's ERROR debris swallows the tail of the one that was
 * blanked, and a member the file declares goes missing. Measured at

 * that is resolution; the other forty-six are EMITTED, and each has a fixture
 * in the inline corpus that exercises it.
 *
 * §11: a tolerance kept past the point where it tolerates anything is one
 * nobody re-examines, and it quietly re-authorises the next regression. So at

/**
 * Accessors: exactly one `cs_method` row each, both directions.
 *
 * ## Why this is a day-one gate and not an assumption
 *
 * `cs_property` and `cs_method` describe the same getter BY DESIGN — IL has
 * accessors as methods, and an engine resolving `x.P` needs a declared callable
 * to resolve it TO. That makes
 * this the single most likely place in the schema for a construct to be reached
 * by two visit paths, and **duplicates do not collide, they DOUBLE**: the owner,
 * the role and the position would all be identical, so the primary key would be
 * too, and the row count would quietly double with nothing looking wrong.
 *
 * The scale is why it cannot be left implicit. Measured on a real corpus:
 * 60,783 declared accessors plus 5,666 expression-bodied properties contribute
 * **66,449 `cs_method` rows against 97,113 method declarations — a 68%
 * inflation.** Any count of methods that does not filter `isAccessor` is wrong
 * by two thirds.
 *
 * Three assertions, from the schema's §4A.2:
 *
 * 1. every declared accessor has exactly one `cs_method` row;
 * 2. `isAccessor = true` iff `ownerMemberLinkHash` is non-empty AND resolves;
 * 3. `methodKind` is an accessor kind iff `isAccessor` is true.

 * heard of, and whether that method is visible depends on which namespaces are
 * imported at the call site. Three facts make the edge reconstructable — the
 * `this`-parameter marker, the declaring static class, and this — and a missing
 * row here is a call edge nothing can rebuild.
 *
 * The IMPLICIT case is the one with no syntax: 59 projects in the measured
 * corpus enable `<ImplicitUsings>`, and `System.Linq` is then in scope for every
 * file with no directive to point at. A file-walking extractor produces zero
 * rows for exactly the namespaces `xs.Where(…)` needs.

/**
 * `#if` SELECTION, in every position it can appear.
 *
 * ## The defect this exists to prevent is an INVERSION, not a shortfall
 *
 * The statement walk resolved every `#if` against an EMPTY symbol set. Inside a
 * method body the `#if` branch was therefore never taken and the `#else` always
 * was — in every file, whatever the module row said the configuration was. The
 * block walk did not resolve branches at all and emitted the locals of BOTH.
 *
 * A missing row is a shortfall an engine can be told about. This was worse: the
 * fact base named one configuration and contained the other, so everything read
 * from a multi-targeting repository below the declaration level was about a
 * program that was not selected.
 *
 * ## Why one position was not enough
 *
 * The old check tested TYPES, which were correct all along — the type, member,
 * using, attribute and region walks all threaded the symbol set properly and
 * exactly one call did not. A check that covers the position that works cannot
 * see the position that does not, and there was no gate comparing them.
 *
 * So this asserts BOTH DIRECTIONS in all seven: nothing from the untaken branch
 * is present, and everything from the taken branch is. The negative direction
 * alone would pass on a parser that emitted nothing at all.

 * put the thing wanted first. `this.Foo` exposes `this` through a FIELD as an
 * anonymous token, so position 0 was the METHOD NAME — 19,832 call sites in
 * linq-heavy-A reported the callee's own name as the receiver type. A named argument
 * puts its label first and `M(label: Scale(n))` dropped the call. A comment is
 * a named child and shifted every index after it.
 *
 * A sweep found ELEVEN more reads with a field available, each right only by
 * accident. All are fields now. What remains is exactly the set below, and each
 * entry says why position is the only thing the grammar offers there.
 *
 * ## Why a declared list and not a ban
 *
 * Three nodes genuinely have no field: a single-child wrapper has nothing to
 * name. Banning the pattern would force a worse read. Declaring it makes the
 * next one a NAMED failure with a reason to write, which is the same discipline
 * as `extractor-grammar-reads.json` one level down.

/**
 * Extraction is LINEAR in statements per method body.
 *
 * ## The defect this exists to prevent
 *
 * CS-CORPUS-16. Three full walks of the body were computed inside a helper
 * that ran once per statement root, so a body of N statements walked itself 3N
 * times. cs-corpus measured it — 250 statements 39 s, 500 statements 163 s,
 * 1,000 killed, against 2,000 in 13 s on the commit before — and it blocked
 * the whole sweep, because linq-heavy-A's generated baselines hold methods of that
 * size and linq-heavy-A is 65% of the corpus's call sites.
 *
 * A verification trimmed to fit the memory the box had left did not see it,
 * because it trimmed out exactly the files that exhaust memory. A check sized
 * to pass is a check incapable of failing, at the corpus level.
 *
 * ## Why NODE VISITS and not wall clock — CS-ORACLE-5
 *
 * This check used a ratio of two wall-clock timings, and that ratio is a
 * fraction whose DENOMINATOR is the noisy term. Measured twice on one commit,
 * minutes apart, on a busy machine:
 *
 *     run 1   500 statements 0.73 s, 2000 statements 6.39 s   ratio 8.8  FAIL
 *     run 2   500 statements 2.61 s, 2000 statements 4.22 s   ratio 1.6  PASS
 *
 * The 500-statement baseline swung 3.6× for identical input. The false FAILURE
 * is the harmless direction — it is loud and gets re-run. The dangerous one is
 * that an INFLATED baseline SHRINKS the ratio, so a genuinely quadratic
 * extractor on a loaded machine reports a small ratio and goes GREEN. The check
 * guarding the regression that once killed a corpus sweep would have hidden it,
 * under exactly the conditions a corpus sweep runs under.
 *
 * So this counts WORK, not time. Every accessor on tree-sitter's shared
 * SyntaxNode prototype is wrapped with a counter for the duration of the check,
 * and the number of node accesses is a pure function of the algorithm and the
 * input: 573,525 at 500 statements and 2,288,025 at 2,000, IDENTICAL on repeat,
 * and identical on any machine. Linear is ×3.99; quadratic would be ~×16.
 *
 * The counter is verified every run — the same size is measured twice and must
 * agree — and if the prototype cannot be instrumented the check reports
 * INCONCLUSIVE and FAILS. An inconclusive is honest; a machine-dependent pass
 * is not. Wall clock is still printed, and is no longer the verdict.
 *
 * ## Do not revert this to wall clock for convenience
 *
 * Determinism buys more than a trustworthy verdict. It makes a NULL RESULT
 * LEGIBLE AS NULL rather than as noise, and that is what caught the first
 * attempt to prove this check can fail.
 *
 * That attempt reintroduced CS-CORPUS-16's shape into the `Array.isArray(body)`
 * branch of the statement walker — a branch this fixture never takes. The count
 * changed by ZERO visits. Not by a little: by nothing, byte-identical to the
 * clean run, which is only possible if the mutated code never ran. A control
 * that controls nothing, and it was unmistakable at a glance.
 *
 * Under the old timing measure the same mistake would have produced a plausible
 * small wobble — 0.19 s against 0.17 s — and been believed. A measure that
 * cannot distinguish "no effect" from "small effect" cannot validate its own
 * negative control, and a check whose negative control is unverifiable is a
 * check that will pass against a defect exactly once, in the run that matters.
