/**
 * Types, methods, parameters, fields, variables, blocks and heritage, in one
 * walk.
 *
 * ## One walk, and every construct on exactly one path
 *
 * §2 of `BUILDING-A-PARSER.md`: **duplicate keys do not collide, they DOUBLE.**
 * A construct reached by two visit paths mints an identical primary key and the
 * row count quietly doubles with nothing looking wrong — no error, no warning,
 * and every count still plausible. A member decorator reached twice did exactly
 * that in TypeScript.
 *
 * So this is a single recursive dispatch with an explicit context, rather than
 * several passes each looking for what it cares about. Where a construct is
 * genuinely two things — `Foo.prototype.bar = function () {}` is a method
 * declaration *and* an assignment that executes — it is visited once here and
 * once by the expression walker, into **two different relations**, and the two
 * rows point at each other.
 *
 * ## Owner derivation is carried, never re-derived
 *
 * The enclosing type, method, scope and block travel in {@link WalkContext}. The
 * alternative — walking `.parent` pointers or comparing positions at each row —
 * picks the wrong owner whenever two candidates begin at the same offset, which
 * in JavaScript is constant: an IIFE's parenthesis, its function and its call
 * all start together.
 *
 * ## Child keys chain off the parent hash
 *
 * A method's qualified name is built from its owner's, never re-derived from the
 * source. `module.exports = class {}` yields a type whose only name is its
 * file's, and two such files in one directory would collide on any name-derived
 * key.

   * Nodes a declaring construct has already handled in full.
   *
   * ## The rule this makes mechanical
   *
   * §6 says a tree rooted at a non-emitting node dies before its children are
   * enqueued; constraint 4 says a construct reached by two visit paths mints an
   * identical key and DOUBLES. The two pull in opposite directions, and the walk
   * resolved them by having every declaring construct `return` — which satisfies
   * the second and violates the first.
   *
   * It cost 116 callables over 4,561 files, in four shapes that all look
   * different and are one bug:
   *
   * - `Query.prototype._find = wrapThunk(function (cb) { … })` — the value is a
   *   CALL, so it takes the field branch and the function inside it vanishes.
   *   26 in one file of one package.
   * - `Object.assign(Foo.prototype, mixin(), { … })` — a non-literal argument is
   *   skipped and never walked.
   * - `Object.defineProperty(F.prototype, 'x', { value: wrap(function () {}) })`
   *   — only `get` and `set` are consumed.
   * - `util.inherits(Child, makeBase())` — the arguments are read as a heritage
   *   expression and never walked for declarations.
   *
   * Every one of them lost a js_method row, its parameters, its body and its
   * scope, with nothing missing from any count anyone was looking at.
   *
   * So the descent is now UNCONDITIONAL and the CONSUMPTION is explicit: a
   * construct that fully handles a subtree says so, and the generic walk skips
   * exactly that subtree and nothing else. Both rules hold at once, and neither
   * depends on remembering to write a descent by hand at a new call site.
   *
   * ## Per FILE, and that is load-bearing
   *
   * `nodeKey` is `kind:start:end`, which is unique within a source file and
   * **not across one** — two files have a node of the same kind at the same
   * offsets constantly. This extractor is constructed once per file inside
   * `extractJavaScriptFile`, so the set dies with the file. A longer-lived one
   * would silently suppress emission in the second file of every pair that
   * happened to collide, which is constraint 1's failure mode exactly: right on
   * ten files, dropping rows on ten thousand.

 *
 * A constructor function is recognised from evidence — `new X`, `X.prototype`,
 * `util.inherits(X, …)`, a body assigning to `this`. That evidence names an
 * IDENTIFIER. Finding the callable that identifier refers to is the other half,
 * and before this the only shape it could follow was `function X() {}`.
 *
 * Four shapes, all measured in the corpus and all previously lost:
 *
 * ```js
 * var B = function (x) {};              // anonymous, bound by a declaration
 * var C = function C(x) {};             // named function expression
 * exports.F = function (x) {};          // bound to a property, never to a local
 * var E = exports.E = function (x) {};  // both at once — the 2015-era spelling
 * ```
 *
 * The last is why the chain is followed rather than matched: `var E = <assign>`
 * has a BinaryExpression initializer whose right side is the callable, and both
 * `E` and the property name are names the same function answers to.
 *
 * ## An arrow is deliberately absent
 *
 * `var B = () => {}` cannot be a constructor: an arrow has no `[[Construct]]`
 * and `new B()` is a TypeError. Including it would mint a js_type for something
 * the language forbids instantiating.
