/**
 * Which `package.json` GOVERNS a `.js` file, and therefore whether it is
 * CommonJS or ESM.
 *
 * ## Why this is the first thing built, and built once
 *
 * `js_module.moduleSystem` is **in the primary key**, so this answer propagates
 * into every child hash in the fact base. A wrong answer does not produce a
 * wrong column — it partitions two identical programs into two incomparable
 * fact sets, or merges two different ones. There is no later pass that can
 * correct it.
 *
 * ## This is §9 of `BUILDING-A-PARSER.md` in its nastier form
 *
 * *Read the governing config per file, never one config per run.* TypeScript
 * has the same rule for `tsconfig.json`, but JavaScript's version is worse in
 * three specific ways:
 *
 * 1. **The governing file is frequently not in the repository.** A `.js` file
 *    inside a dependency is governed by that dependency's own `package.json`,
 *    and a loose script directory is governed by nothing at all — 15.4% of the
 *    measured corpus has no `package.json` anywhere up the tree.
 * 2. **There is no `include`/`exclude`.** Nearest ancestor wins, full stop. A
 *    `package.json` cannot disown a file, so unlike `TsConfigResolver` the walk
 *    stops at the first one found rather than continuing past a config that
 *    does not claim the file.
 * 3. **`.mjs` and `.cjs` override it outright.** They are not hints and they do
 *    not merely win a tie: the extension *is* the declaration, and no
 *    `package.json` can contradict it. So the extension check happens before
 *    the walk, not after it.
 *
 * ## What "nearest ancestor" means precisely
 *
 * Node's rule, which this implements: walk from the file's own directory
 * upward, and the **first** directory containing a `package.json` decides.
 * Absence of a `"type"` field in that file is a real answer — the spec's default
 * is CommonJS — and it is recorded distinctly from an explicit
 * `"type": "commonjs"` (`PKG_TYPE_ABSENT_DEFAULT` versus
 * `PKG_TYPE_COMMONJS`), because 76.0% of files land on the former and they are
 * not making the same claim.
 *
 * ## No Program, no network, no install
 *
 * Reading a `package.json` is `fs.readFileSync` and `JSON.parse`. Nothing here
 * resolves a module, typechecks anything, or needs `node_modules` to exist.
 *
 * ## Caching discipline
 *
 * Two caches, both keyed on **absolute directory paths** — never on a node, a
 * file object, or anything with an identity that can be recycled. The
 * per-directory cache is what makes this O(depth) once rather than O(files ×
 * depth): a 1,045-file package shares one answer for its whole subtree.
