/**
 * C#-specific tree-sitter parser.
 *
 * ## The 32,767-character parse limit
 *
 * tree-sitter cannot parse a buffer longer than 32,767 characters in one shot.
 * This parser owns the workaround so every consumer inherits it, rather than
 * each extractor rediscovering it — the same reason `java-parser.ts` and
 * `python-parser.ts` own theirs. C# files run long: measured on the 9,568-file
 * corpus, the limit is the common path for real code and not an edge case, and
 * the failure is a throw rather than a silent truncation.
 *
 * ## The grammar gate
 *
 * The constructor asserts the installed grammar loads and that every known
 * limitation is STILL a limitation. It is a
 * constructor check and not a comment because the failure mode of the wrong
 * grammar is that **nothing throws** — 6% of declarations simply are not there.
 * See {@link assertPatchedGrammar}.
 *
 * ## The byte-order mark
 *
 * A UTF-8 BOM is an ENCODING PREAMBLE, not the first character of the program.
 * Roslyn's `SourceText` decodes it away, so every position Roslyn reports is
 * into text that never contained it. Left in place it is a character of line 1,
 * and every column on line 1 is one too far right — silently, because the file
 * still parses and every row is still there. 457 of modern-app-A's 547 files carry
 * one; the only rows that moved were the ones with a call on line 1, which is
 * why nine sites read as nine lost rows and nine phantom ones rather than as
 * the single encoding fact it is.
 *
 * It is stripped HERE, next to the 32,767-character workaround and for the
 * same reason: one place, so every consumer inherits it rather than each
 * extractor rediscovering it. {@link stripUtf8Bom} is exported so a caller
 * that also needs the source text can normalise the SAME string it hands in —
 * a tree built from stripped text and a length measured on unstripped text
 * disagree by three bytes, and the parse-gap rows are computed from that
 * length.
 *
 * ## Why the file is never split
 *
 * Splitting the source and parsing the halves would produce two roots with no
 * containment between them, and counts that look plausible while the scope
 * forest is silently wrong. The callback streams one logical parse over one
 * tree instead.
 */
/**
 * U+FEFF at the start of a decoded UTF-8 stream — the byte-order mark.
 *
 * Only at the START. A U+FEFF anywhere else is a zero-width no-break space and
 * a legal character of the program, so `replace` would be wrong; the preamble
 * is a property of position 0 alone.
 */

 * Removes a leading UTF-8 BOM, and nothing else.
