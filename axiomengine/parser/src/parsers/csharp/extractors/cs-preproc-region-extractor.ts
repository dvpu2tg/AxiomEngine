/**
 * `cs_preproc_region` — the audit trail for which branch this emission took.
 *
 * ## Every other relation records what was emitted; this records what FROM
 *
 * A `#if NET8_0` chain means one branch is in the program and the others are
 * not — their calls are not edges and their types are not declared. That is the
 * right answer, and without a row saying which branch was taken and WHY it is
 * unfalsifiable: `isActive = false` has three unrelated causes that look
 * identical in the data.
 *
 * `activationSource` separates them. `UNEVALUATED` is the only one that is a
 * limitation of this parser, and naming it is what makes the cost countable
 * rather than a percentage nobody can act on.
 *
 * ## The chain NESTS, and treating it as siblings duplicates the subtree
 *
 * `#elif` is a CHILD of the `#if`, and `#else` a child of the last `#elif`. A
 * walker that read them as siblings would descend into the `#else` body while
 * believing it was still in the `#if` — §6's "tree rooted at a non-emitting
 * node" with the sign flipped, and duplicates DOUBLE.
