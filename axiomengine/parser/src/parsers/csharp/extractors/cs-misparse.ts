/**
 * COHERENT MISPARSES OF THE PUBLISHED GRAMMAR, recognised in one place.
 *
 * `tree-sitter-c-sharp` 0.23.1 fails a set of shapes in two different ways, and
 * the distinction decides what can be done about each:
 *
 *   ERROR     an ERROR node. Rows are lost, and `cs_parse_gap` emits a row
 *             saying so — a consumer can see the file was not fully read and
 *             refuse to trust it. 41 shapes. Nothing here can help: there is no
 *             structure left to read.
 *
 *   MISPARSE  no error, and the WRONG tree. The fact base is well-formed and
 *             wrong, and NOTHING reports it. 7 shapes. This module is for those.
 *
 * Only the second kind is a trust problem, and it is the worse one: a lost row
 * is visible in a count, a wrong row is not. For static analysis a silently
 * wrong edge is worse than a missing one, because it is acted upon.
 *
 * ## Every detector needs a negative control, and that is the hard part
 *
 * A misparse is recognised by the SHAPE the grammar produced, and a shape is
 * not proof of intent. `Local(x) = v` misparses into the same tree a real
 * deconstruction `var (a, b) = e` produces, so a detector keyed only on "a
 * declarator holding a tuple pattern" would rewrite legitimate code and invent
 * calls that the source never wrote. Inventing an edge is worse than losing
 * one.
 *
 * So each detector below states the discriminator it relies on, and each has a
 * control in the suite asserting the legitimate shape is NOT touched.

/**
 * `Local(instance) = value;` — an assignment to a REF-RETURNING call, which the
 * published grammar reads as a local declaration.
 *
 * What it produces:
 *
 *     variable_declaration
 *       identifier "Local"              <- read as the TYPE
 *       variable_declarator
 *         tuple_pattern (instance)      <- read as a deconstruction target
 *         identifier "value"            <- read as the initializer
 *
 * which is a declaration of a variable whose type is `Local`, and a phantom
 * local per argument. The call is gone and nothing errors. Measured at ~3,400
 * lost calls across the corpus when the fork's rule for it was absent.
 *
 * THE DISCRIMINATOR is the declared type, and it is exact rather than
 * heuristic. A tuple declarator is only legal C# after `var`:
 *
 *     var (a, b) = e;      implicit_type    -> a REAL deconstruction. Untouched.
 *     (a, b) = e;          no declaration   -> already an assignment. Untouched.
 *     int x = 1;           identifier name  -> not a tuple pattern. Untouched.
 *     Local(x) = v;        identifier type  -> THE MISPARSE.
 *     A.ById(o) = v;       qualified_name   -> THE MISPARSE.
 *
 * Verified in all five directions before this was written, because the first
 * four are the ones a wrong detector would damage.

 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT FIX, stated because the residue is real: when a single
 * operator chain contains more than one `?.`, the operator NESTING the grammar
 * produced is left as it is. `x?.T == y?.T && x?.B == y?.B` comes out with each
 * receiver right and each operator's operands right, but `==` at the root where
 * `&&` belongs. Correcting that means re-deciding precedence over a flattened
 * operand sequence — re-parsing the expression, not repairing a node — and a
 * parser that re-parses its own input has two grammars to keep in agreement.
 * The torture fixture asserts both halves: the receiver recovered, the nesting
 * not.
