/**
 * Finds the EXPRESSION ROOTS inside a statement body.
 *
 * ## The allowlist governs EXPRESSIONS, not the descent
 *
 * §6 says use an allowlist of expression positions, and that still holds — what
 * becomes a `cs_expression` row is decided by {@link isExpressionNode} and
 * nothing else, so a type name in a statement position emits nothing.
 *
 * But the first version also had an allowlist of STATEMENT CONTAINERS, and that
 * was a mistake with a measured cost. It listed `for_each_statement`; the
 * grammar's node is `foreach_statement`. The name matched nothing, so a
 * `foreach` was neither descended into nor read for expressions — **every
 * expression and every call in every `foreach` body was invisible**, and no
 * count could see it because the enclosing method's other statements were all
 * present. `else_clause` was the same: the grammar has no such node, `if` binds
 * its branches as `consequence` and `alternative` fields.
 *
 * So the descent is now TOTAL. Anything that is not an expression is walked
 * into. An unrecognised statement contributes its expressions instead of
 * swallowing its subtree, which is the same "unwrap in one place" discipline
 * that `PARENTHESIZED` needed — a node that produces no row must not take its
 * children with it.
 *
 * The statement table that remains says only what CONTEXT a position gets, and
 * a statement missing from it still yields its expressions, under
 * `UNKNOWN_CONTEXT`. That value being emitted is a signal, not a defect: it
 * names a position nobody has classified yet.
 *
 * ## Lambda bodies are NOT walked here
 *
 * §6 again: the worklist stops at function boundaries. A lambda's body belongs
 * to the lambda's own `cs_method` row, and walking it with the enclosing method
 * as owner attributes every call inside a callback to whoever created it.
 * {@link collectLambdas} finds them so the caller can give each one an owner.
