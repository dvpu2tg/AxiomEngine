/**
 * `cs_type_reference` — the type-reference TREE.
 *
 * `Dictionary<string, List<int?>>` is four references, not one string, and
 * `parentReferenceHash` + `position` + `depth` reconstruct the nesting.
 *
 * ## Reification is why the tree is kept
 *
 * C# generics are reified: `List<int>` and `List<string>` are **distinct
 * runtime types** with distinct method tables, where Java erases both to `List`.
 * The type-argument subtree is therefore part of the type's IDENTITY rather
 * than decoration a compiler discards. Flattening it to `completeTypeName`
 * would leave the engine unable to ask "which constructions of `List` exist in
 * this program", which is a question about reachable code in C# and is not one
 * in Java.
 *
 * ## Wrapper or column, decided per shape
 *
 * §3 says the variant belongs in a field, and the schema gives four fields for
 * exactly that. So:
 *
 * | shape | representation | why |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `int[,]` | COLUMN `arrayRank = 2` | Java does the same with `arrayDimensions`, and the element type is what matters |
 * | `string?` | COLUMN `isNullableAnnotated` | a wrapper would hide the real shape behind it |
 * | `int*` | COLUMN `isPointer` + kind `POINTER` | one node, both facts |
 * | `(int, string)` | WRAPPER, elements as children | the elements have no other home, and `tupleElementCount` alone would lose their types |
 * | `List<int>` | WRAPPER, arguments as children | the whole reification argument |
 * | `ref int` | WRAPPER | an alias is not the thing it aliases, and no column says so |
 *
 * ## An allowlist of positions, never a generic walk
 *
 * §6: a generic tree walk puts type names into the expression relation, and
 * type-only constructs then reach the call graph. Every call into this module
 * names the CONTEXT it is extracting from, so a position that has not been
 * thought about emits nothing rather than something wrong.
