/**
 * BLANK THE BRANCHES THIS EMISSION DOES NOT COMPILE, BEFORE PARSING.
 *
 * tree-sitter parses both arms of a `#if`; Roslyn parses one. That mismatch is
 * the single largest source of C# parse failures, because the published grammar
 * has no rule for a directive in most declaration positions and recovers with
 * an ERROR node — 30 of the 41 shapes it cannot read are preprocessor shapes,
 * and on the BCL stratum they cost 1,890 parse gaps and 11.9 points of recall.
 *
 * None of that is the grammar's fault and none of it needs a fork. The parser
 * already knows which branch this emission takes: the target framework and the
 * define set are inputs, in `cs_module`'s primary key. So the directives and the
 * untaken arms are blanked to WHITESPACE before the grammar ever sees the text,
 * and what it gets is ordinary C#.
 *
 * Measured: 27 of the 30 preprocessor torture fixtures stop erroring.
 *
 * ## Blanked, never removed
 *
 * Every blanked character becomes a space and every newline is kept, so the
 * text stays byte-for-byte the same LENGTH. Offsets, lines and columns are
 * therefore unchanged, and every span the extractors emit still points at the
 * real source. Deleting the regions instead would shift every position after
 * the first directive — which is the defect the BOM fix was about, at the scale
 * of a whole file.
 *
 * ## It also makes branch selection structural
 *
 * The extractors resolve `#if` branches while walking, so a row from an untaken
 * arm was always a possibility that had to be checked for. After blanking the
 * untaken arm is not in the text: no row can come from it, because there is
 * nothing there to walk. That is a stronger guarantee than a check.
