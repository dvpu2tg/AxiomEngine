 * ```
 *
 * The `#if` splits the arrow body, and the grammar recovers by producing a
 * `property_declaration` named GetDefaultMessage with an ERROR child holding
 * the `()`, followed by a `method_declaration` NAMED `public`. Roslyn says
 * ordinary method. The parser emitted a property with a getter called
 * get_GetDefaultMessage — a correctly-positioned row with the wrong kind, the
 * classification defect exactly, and it passed every count-based check.
 *
 * The rule is the one from DELEGATE_INVOKE: a lookup miss is DON'T KNOW, and
 * the terminal for don't-know is never a positive claim. Two signals say the
 * kind is a guess, and ONLY these two:
 *
 * - a `property_declaration` with an ERROR among its direct children. The
 *   property/method confusion runs exactly one way — a method whose `()` fell
 *   into the ERROR is recovered as a property — so a property with header
 *   debris is the one shape whose kind cannot be trusted;
 * - a member whose NAME is a C# keyword. `public` is not a method name; it is
 *   the next member's modifier, swallowed.
 *
 * A `method_declaration` with an ERROR child KEEPS its row: a method whose
 * RETURN TYPE a `#if` splits still has its name and its parameter list, and
 * withholding it would drop every call in its body for a header that is
 * mostly intact. A type declaration is never withheld — its kind is its
 * keyword, which the grammar cannot confuse, and dropping a class drops
 * everything in it. In every case the ERROR is already a `cs_parse_gap` row
 * naming the node, so the loss that IS taken is recorded rather than silent.
 *
 * ## Since the fork's grammar
 *
 * The shape above is a CLEAN PARSE now: `preproc_if_in_function_body` and
 * `preproc_if_in_property_body` give a `#if`-split body one node per branch,
 * and the body read is the branch this emission takes. No shape in the gate
 * corpus reaches this rule any more, and its negative control was removed
 * with that reason. It stays as a net for recoveries nobody has seen, on the
 * same principle — a kind that is a guess is withheld, and the gap row says
 * where — and the day a fixture produces debris again, the control returns.

 *
 * The expression walk started at method bodies AND NOTHING ELSE. Measured on
 * 5,773 linq-heavy-A files: `CsExpressionOwnerKind` was 1 of 11 — only `METHOD` had
 * ever been emitted — so a field initializer, a property initializer, a
 * parameter default, an enum member value and a constructor initializer
 * contributed no expressions at all.
 *
 * `static readonly Regex Rx = new Regex("...")` is an object creation and a
 * call site, and neither existed in the fact base. Nothing counted it, because
 * the enclosing type's methods were all present and the count of expressions
 * was large and plausible.
 *
 * ## The OWNER is the declaration, not the enclosing method
 *
 * There is no enclosing method. A field initializer runs from the constructor
 * the compiler synthesises, and attributing it to some nearby method would put
 * a call on a stack it never appears on. `callerMethodLinkHash` is therefore
 * empty for these, and `cs_call_site` records a call whose CALLER is a
 * declaration — which is the truth, and the engine's to attach to whichever
 * constructor it decides runs it.

 * public int Q => _x;                  // arrow_expression_clause, ZERO accessors
 * ```
 *
 * `Q` has a getter. It is a call target, it is 5,666 sites in the corpus, and
 * there is no `get` token anywhere to find. Emitting accessors only where the
 * keyword appears loses every one of them, and loses no row any count would
 * miss, because the property row is still there.
 *
 * ## `#if` inside an accessor list, which the grammar does not nest
 *
 * This is one of cs-oracle's 1.60% "`#if` splits a construct" cases, and it is
 * live in CommunityToolkit:
 *
 * ```csharp
 * public int Length
 * {
 * #if NET8_0_OR_GREATER
 *     get => this.length;
 * #elif NETSTANDARD2_1_OR_GREATER
 *     get => this.Span.Length;
 * #else
 *     get;
 * #endif
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The grammar does NOT produce a `preproc_if` here. It absorbs the `#if` line
 * into the FIRST accessor as a `preproc_if_in_attribute_list` child, turns the
 * `#elif` into an accessor whose **name is the preprocessor symbol**, and emits
 * `#else` and `#endif` as bare `ERROR` siblings.
 *
 * Two consequences, and both were real:
 *
 * 1. `ACCESSOR_METHOD_KIND[keyword]` was an unguarded lookup, so the
 *    symbol-named accessor made it **throw** — two files of the corpus failed
 *    extraction entirely.
 * 2. Taking every `accessor_declaration` would emit THREE getters for one
 *    property: one per branch, from branches that never compile together. That
 *    breaks the accessor 1:1 gate and violates "no row from an inactive branch".
 *
 * So the chain is reconstructed from the debris: the condition is read off the
 * absorbed `preproc_if_in_attribute_list`, the `ERROR` siblings move the state
 * machine, and only the active branch's accessors are emitted. The `#elif`
 * branch's accessor is **unrecoverable** — its `get` keyword was consumed by the
 * error — so when that branch is the active one the accessor is genuinely lost,
 * and that is the irreducible part.
