/**
 * `cs_expression` and `cs_call_site` — the spine.
 *
 * A WORKLIST traversal, ported from `expression-reference-extractor.ts` as it
 * was for Python and TypeScript: a node is turned into a row, its children are
 * enqueued with their roles, and the queue is drained. Recursion would blow the
 * stack on generated code, and a queue makes the depth cap a subtraction rather
 * than a call-frame count.
 *
 * ## Four rules from §6, each of which cost a measured number of rows
 *
 * **1. An allowlist of positions, never a generic walk.** A generic walk puts
 * type names into the expression relation, and type-only constructs then reach
 * the call graph. Every entry point below names the context it is extracting
 * from.
 *
 * **2. A tree rooted at a non-emitting node dies before its children are
 * enqueued.** `return (a && b.c())` cost admin-ui 1,808 expressions and
 * `{t(msg)}` in JSX cost 4,488 of 14,335 call sites — both because a wrapper
 * produced no row and took its subtree with it. Here `PARENTHESIZED` **emits a
 * row**, and unwrapping happens in ONE place, {@link unwrapForRoot}, so no
 * position can be handled for one construct and missed for another.
 *
 * **3. The worklist stops at function boundaries — descend explicitly.** A
 * lambda's body belongs to the lambda's own method row. `return function () { … }`
 * emitted the function and nothing inside it, costing 45 of 691 call sites, and
 * every row that WAS emitted was correct — there were simply fewer.
 *
 * **4. Brace every branch.** A dangling `else` in dispatch-heavy code silently
 * doubles or drops output.
 *
 * ## One wrapper, children parented, variant in a column
 *
 * §3's rule, and the reason `EVENT_SUBSCRIBE` exists: `button.Click += Handler`
 * is a subscription that registers an edge firing later, not a compound
 * assignment. Emitting the parts without the wrapper is the defect class that
 * has recurred in every language here.

/**
 * Whether a BARE NAME is a method group — and why neither test alone is enough.

 *
 * "A bare name in a value position, not being called" describes a method group.
 * It also describes every variable, every field, every property and every
 * parameter passed as an argument. Marking all of them produced **2,080
 * METHOD_GROUP rows in multitarget-A alone**, which would tell an engine that two
 * thousand methods are referenced-but-never-called. §5 is explicit: a kind that
 * syntax cannot decide must be RESERVED, not guessed, because guessing is wrong
 * more often than it is right.
 *
 * ## What makes it decidable is a SAME-FILE, ONE-HOP fact
 *
 * The name must also be **declared as a method on the enclosing type**. That is
 * not resolution — it is one lookup in a set the extractor already built, in the
 * same file, with no using scope and no inheritance walked. It is exactly the
 * class of link the IR rule permits.
 *
 * ## And it applies to BARE NAMES ONLY
 *
 * The same test on `x.M` is unsound, because `M` would have to be a method on
 * the RECEIVER's type and this set holds the ENCLOSING type's. Applied there it
 * produced 108 rows in multitarget-A whose first six were `Level.Low`,
 * `.Mid`, `.High` — enum members, matched because the enclosing class
 * declares methods of those names. `INSTANCE_METHOD_GROUP` is therefore
 * RESERVED with a zero-row assertion, and a bare name is the only form filled.
 *
 * Still an over-approximation in one direction: a local or field shadowing a
 * method name reads as a group. And an under-approximation in the other: a
 * group whose target is inherited or an extension is missed. Both are the
 * engine's to settle, and both are far smaller than either test made alone.
