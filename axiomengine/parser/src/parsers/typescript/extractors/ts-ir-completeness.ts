/**
 * Measures whether the IR is COMPLETE — not whether the parser resolved.
 *
 * ## Why resolution rate is the wrong measure
 *
 * The parser emits IR; the engine builds the call graph. The Java precedent is
 * unambiguous and stronger than any count: `java_type_reference`'s
 * `referencedTypeRegistryLinkHash` is not merely empty in every output — **no
 * Java extractor contains a statement that fills it.** The engine joins
 * `typeName` against `java_type` in `type-resolution.dl`, and that is the design.
 *
 * So "26 of 11,529 call sites use the declared-receiver-type path" is not a
 * hole. The question that matters is different, and this file answers it:
 *
 *   For every call the parser did not resolve, are the facts an engine needs in
 *   order to resolve it actually present?
 *
 * ## The triple, for a receiver whose type lives in another file
 *
 *   1. the receiver's declared type NAME AS WRITTEN — `ts_call_site.receiverTypeName`
 *   2. the importing module — `ts_call_site.tsModuleLinkHash`
 *   3. `ts_import.resolvedFilePath` for the import that binds that name
 *
 * With those three the engine joins and the parser is done. A call site missing
 * any of them is a genuine parser gap. A call site missing NONE of them, and
 * still unresolved, is the parser working exactly as intended.
 *
 * ## And the hop chain, for the receiver itself
 *
 * Path 1 needs more than a name: it needs to get from the call site to the
 * receiver's DECLARATION and from there to its annotation. Each link is a column
 * the parser owns, so each is checkable here:
 *
 *   ts_call_site.receiverExpressionLinkHash
 *     -> ts_expression.referencedEntityHash
 *       -> ts_variable | ts_method_parameter | ts_field  [.typeReferenceLinkHash]
 *         -> ts_type_reference.completeTypeName
 *
 * A break anywhere in that chain is unrecoverable downstream, and invisible in
 * any resolution percentage.
