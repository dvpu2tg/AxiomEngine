   * target, and the target is this member. A type literal has no `ts_type` row —
   * 5,015 of them measured, none with a name, a declaration or a merge identity —
   * so the member has no owner to hang off and no other pass reaches it. It was
   * the single cause of the entire syntactic-recall shortfall: 1,052 of 20,313
   * declaration-bearing nodes on this repository, all of them type-literal
   * members or their parameters.
   *
   * ## What these rows can and cannot carry
   *
   * `tsTypeLinkHash` is `""`, because the owner genuinely is not a `ts_type`.
   * The annotation travels as TEXT in `fieldTypeName` / `returnTypeName`, which
   * is the same mechanism `ts_call_site.receiverTypeName` uses and the same one
   * the engine already joins on.
   *
   * What is NOT here is an FK from the type literal to its members. No column
   * exists for it: `ts_field.tsTypeLinkHash` points at `ts_type`, and an
   * anonymous shape has none. Raised with ts-oracle; emitting the rows without
   * it is still strictly better than emitting nothing, because name, arity,
   * optionality and position are exactly what a member lookup needs.
   *
   * `typeReferenceLinkHash` is left empty ON PURPOSE. The member's annotation is
   * already in the tree as a `TYPE_ELEMENT` child of the type literal, at the
   * same position; extracting it again under the member as owner would duplicate
   * every annotation inside every anonymous shape.
