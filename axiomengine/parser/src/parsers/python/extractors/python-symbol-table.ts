 * - `free`    — names a block or its descendants failed to bind locally and
 *               therefore captured; spliced back up on the way out.
 *
 * The class-body asymmetry is the subtle part and it is load-bearing: a class
 * namespace has **no effect** on names visible in nested functions, so a method
 * cannot see its class's attributes as locals. That is why the `bound` set is
 * populated *before* class variables are added, and why `drop_class_free`
