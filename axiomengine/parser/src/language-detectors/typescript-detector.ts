/**
 * Detects TypeScript projects.
 *
 * `tsconfig.json` is the strong signal, and unlike Python's manifests it is not
 * merely conventional: it DEFINES the program, so a directory that has one is a
 * project boundary by the compiler's own reckoning. That matters more here than
 * elsewhere, because a program is also the unit of merge scope — two programs
 * have two global scopes, and analysing them as one merges symbols tsc keeps
 * apart.
 *
 * `package.json` alone is not enough: a JavaScript package with no TypeScript in
 * it would match, and analysing it would produce an empty fact base attributed
 * to a language it does not use. Source files are the fallback signal, exactly
 * as they are for Python.
 *
 * `node_modules` is excluded by name during the walk. It is not a scale
 * optimisation — the files in there are real TypeScript, and analysing them as
 * PROJECT code would stage tens of thousands of third-party declarations into
 * `ts_*` when they belong in `lib_ts_*`, which is the one distinction the whole
 * provenance split exists to make.
