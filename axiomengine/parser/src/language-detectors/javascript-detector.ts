/**
 * Detects JavaScript projects.
 *
 * ## The hard part is not finding JavaScript; it is not claiming TypeScript
 *
 * Almost every TypeScript project contains JavaScript — config files, build
 * scripts, compiled output — and almost every one has a `package.json`. So a
 * detector that matches on `package.json`, or on the mere presence of a `.js`
 * file, claims TypeScript repositories and their facts land under the wrong
 * language.
 *
 * The rule that prevents that: **a manifest alone is not enough.** JavaScript
 * source must actually be present in the directory itself. `package.json` is
 * the manifest of *both* languages and of plenty of repositories that contain
 * neither.
 *
 * A `tsconfig.json` used to disqualify the directory outright, on the ground
 * that it DEFINES a TypeScript program. Since a directory can be several
 * projects at once (#566), that exclusion cost real code: a JavaScript
 * repository typechecked through a root `tsconfig.json` with `allowJs` (the
 * standard JSDoc setup) lost every loose `.js` file of that directory, because
 * the TypeScript analyzer emits nothing for `.js` program members and no
 * descendant JavaScript project covers the directory's own files. Those files
 * were exactly the package entry points, and they left no skip row (#595). The
 * TypeScript claim still stands beside this one; the JavaScript claim only adds
 * the `.js` files, which the TypeScript analyzer never emits, so nothing is
 * extracted twice.
 *
 * ## `isProject` is SHALLOW and `hasSourceFiles` is deep
 *
 * The same split the Python and TypeScript detectors make, for the reason the
 * Python one records: the scanner stops descending as soon as a directory claims
 * to be a project, so answering yes for any ancestor that merely *contains*
 * JavaScript swallows every sub-project beneath it. A monorepo root with
 * `packages/a` and `packages/b` would become one project and one of them would
 * never be analysed.
 *
 * `node_modules` is excluded by name during the walk. Not a scale optimisation:
 * those files are real JavaScript, and analysing them as PROJECT code stages
 * third-party declarations into `js_*` when they belong in `lib_js_*` — the one
 * distinction the whole provenance split exists to make.
