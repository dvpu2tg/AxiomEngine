/**
 * Walks a TypeScript repository, extracts the fact spine, and exports it as TSV.
 *
 * ## Accumulate, then export, in a total order
 *
 * Byte-identical output across runs is a gate, not a nicety, and it is not
 * achievable by writing rows as they are found: filesystem enumeration order is
 * not stable across machines. Files are processed in SORTED path order, each
 * extractor emits in a deterministic order within a file, and every row is held
 * in memory until the whole run is done. The Java and Python analyzers do the
 * same, for the same reason.
 *
 * ## A program is the unit of merge scope, so it is the unit of analysis
 *
 * Files are grouped by their GOVERNING tsconfig. Two programs have two global
 * scopes: a global-script `AppConfig` in one is not the same symbol as a
 * global-script `AppConfig` in another, and merging them would be wrong in
 * exactly the direction that looks like successful cross-file merging. Within a
 * program, `GLOBAL` is unambiguous and cross-file merging is correct.
 *
 * The consequence to know: if one run covers several programs, their `GLOBAL`
 * declarations share a merge-scope key. `ts_module.tsConfigPath` distinguishes
 * them, and running one program per invocation avoids the question entirely —
 * which is what the gate does.
