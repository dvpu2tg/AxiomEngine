/**
 * Walks a JavaScript repository, extracts the fact spine, and exports it as TSV.
 *
 * ## What the unit of analysis is, and why it is not a "program"
 *
 * The TypeScript analyzer groups files by their governing `tsconfig.json`,
 * because a program is the unit of merge scope and two programs have two global
 * scopes. **JavaScript has no such unit.** There is no `files`/`include` list to
 * read, no transitive closure to compute, and no declaration merging for a merge
 * scope to matter to. What a JavaScript file has instead is a governing
 * `package.json`, and that decides exactly one thing: whether the file is
 * CommonJS or ESM.
 *
 * So the file list is a directory walk, and the per-file configuration is
 * resolved by {@link PackageJsonResolver}. That is a simplification in the file
 * layer and a complication in the fact layer, because `moduleSystem` ends up in
 * `js_module`'s primary key while `tsConfigPath` is merely a column on
 * `ts_module`.
 *
 * ## Accumulate nothing; stream in a total order
 *
 * Byte-identical output across runs is a gate, and it is not achievable by
 * writing rows as they are *found*: filesystem enumeration order is not stable
 * across machines. Files are processed in **sorted path order**, each extractor
 * emits deterministically within a file, and rows are streamed to per-relation
 * writers as each file finishes — §10 of `BUILDING-A-PARSER.md`, where holding
 * the whole fact base in memory was measured as the single largest cost and the
 * only architectural one.
